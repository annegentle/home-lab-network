# Discovery: Configuring Network Devices to Support APIC-EM Discovery
After you install APIC-EM but before running the Discovery process, work through your lab network to prepare it as described on this page.

## Network Device Discovery Uses CDP Data
APIC-EM describes its network device discovery method as “CDP”, referring to the Cisco Discovery Protocol. With a CDP-based discovery, APIC-EM learns about network devices using the CDP data as exchanged between the networking devices. That is, the devices need to run CDP to learn details about each neighbor, as shown in the next figure.

Cisco devices tend to enable CDP by default. For completeness, the following text shows how to re-enable CDP globally and on each interface on an IOS-based device:
```
cdp run                  ! global command
!
interface gigabitethernet0/1
  cdp enable
! repeat the above cdp enable command on each interface
```
## Network Device Discovery Data Pulled with SNMP
Although APIC-EM uses data gathered by CDP, APIC-EM does not use CDP between the APIC-EM server and the network devices. Instead, APIC-EM uses SNMP to gather the CDP information. Therefore, each networking device needs to enable SNMP; the network devices then include SNMP variables for all the CDP-gathered data. Then APIC-EM can use SNMP to extract that CDP-learned information.

Once APIC-EM discovers a new networking device using SNMP, it adds the device to the Network Information Base and displays the device in the topology map.

As for SNMP configuration, you can use SNMPv2c or SNMPv3 and all you need for discovery is read access. Later, when you use APIC-EM to configure other settings, APIC-EM will use the CLI to configure rather than SNMP sets, so write access is not necessary. For example, this single line of configuration for SNMPv2c enables an IOS router or switch for SNMP with a read-only (ro) community string of “DevNet8*”. When performing APIC-EM discovery, you would need to specific SNMPv2c, and that same community string.
```
snmp-server community DevNet8* ro
```
Note that if you decide to use SNMPv3, the configuration will include both a username and password, rather than a community string with no username.

## Discovery Checks CLI Access (SSHv2 and/or Telnet)
The APIC-EM device discovery process also checks whether APIC-EM can use Telnet and/or SSH to connect to the networking device. Many APIC-EM apps and functions use the CLI, and APIC-EM will need to connect to the network device using SSHv2 or Telnet. During the Discovery process, APIC-EM will test each networking device to ensure that these related features work. For example, as shown in the next figure, the next step in the figure shows APIC-EM attempting to SSH to the various network devices.

The right side of one of the APIC-EM discovery GUI pages shows the results of these checks. In this case, note that the ICMP test (a ping of the device’s IP addresses) all passed, as did the SNMP checks. However, APIC-EM could not login to four of the six network devices in the lab.

You do have some options for Telnet and SSH configuration. Optimally, just configure SSHv2 support on your lab devices, with the same username/password on each device – maybe a username/password set aside for APIC-EM use specifically. However, here are a few of the rules that dictate what you should configure on the network devices:
- The network device must support SSH Version 2 (SSHv2). It may support SSH Version 1 as well, but APIC-EM uses SSHv2 only, so the device must support SSHv2.
- For Telnet, simple password authentication (that is, authentication that requires a password but no username) is not supported.
- You can choose whether to use only Telnet, only SSHv2, or both.

Here’s a sample IOS device configuration that uses local usernames/passwords, and is configured for SSHv2 only on the networking device.

~~~~
username DevNet secret DevNet8*   ! Username for APIC-EM use
username wendell secret odom      ! Username for general use

! Enable all types of inbound connections, including SSH and Telnet
line vty 0 15
  login local
  transport input all

! Need hostname and domain name for key generation to work
hostname SW1
ip domain-name example.com

! Create key, and enable SSH Version 2 only
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
ip ssh version 2
~~~~

## Exercise: Plan Your Lab Device Configurations
Plan the configurations you plan to add to all your lab devices. Unless you want to test the variations in the configurations, use the same settings on each device and one standard set of configuration commands for each different type of OS. The following table references the key values to record:

Feature |Value
------- |-----
Using SNMPv2c or SNMPv3?|
SNMPv2c read-only community|
SNMPv3 username/password|
Using Telnet, SSHv2, or both?|
SSH/Telnet Username/password|
