# Discovery: An Example APIC-EM CDP-Based Discovery
An APIC-EM “Discovery” is a named set of discovery parameters. Once you create a Discovery, along with the associated settings, you can start the discovery repeatedly. That is, once started, APIC-EM again attempts to discover devices, and repeat the ping, SNMP, and Telnet/SSH checks against each discovered device. This page walks through the creation of a new discovery along with starting the Discovery and looking at the results.
## Start a New CDP Discovery with a Seed Device
To define a new Discovery, first navigate to the Discovery section of the GUI, by clicking on the icon of the upper left of the GUI (as noted in the next figure). Then you will need to:
-  Name the Discovery (you can choose the name).
-  Pick an IP address of a network device in your lab network to use as the seed device.
-  Configure the credentials for CLI (SSH and/or Telnet) and SNMP.

Note that for the seed device, any of the networking devices in your lab will work. However, for easier troubleshooting, I recommend referring to the IP address of the lab network router that is closest to the APIC-EM host – that is, the IP address APIC-EM uses as the next-hop-address of its static routes. (That address was 172.20.11.1 in the examples in this Learning Lab.) The idea is that the seed device is one known device, from which APIC-EM will learn CDP data, and from there, be able to identify its neighbors, then those devices’ neighbors, and so on, discovering all devices in the network.

For the credentials, you click “add credentials”, and configure the settings as planned. At a minimum, you must configure at least one set of SNMP credentials (otherwise Discovery cannot work at all) and one username/password for CLI. The right side of the next figure shows a sample of where you would configure CLI credentials.

## Starting a Discovery and Monitoring its Progress
The Discovery pages have a “Start” button at the top, which, when clicked, tells APIC-EM to begin the discovery process. Simple enough.

If you click on that Discovery item in the list on the left of the GUI, you will see a window with Discovery setting and the history of different Discovery runs. If you then click the “view” option (see next figure), it expands a new area of the window on the right, which populates a list with each new device when discovered.

## Discovering the Entire Lab Network
For the best experience using APIC-EM’s APIs, you should work through the discovery process until discovery finds all your network devices, as well showing success for ICMP, SNMP, and CLI in the results list for the discovery. With those results, the APIC-EM API should show data for each device, and any APIC-EM apps that you use should be able to use the CLI functions to re-configure and operate the devices in the network.
