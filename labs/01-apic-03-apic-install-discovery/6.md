# Discovery: Introduction
So far, this DevNet Learning Lab has focused on some key installation questions. Once you then use these facts while installing APIC-EM, you should be able to run APIC-EM, web browse to its IP address to access its GUI, and access its API.

However, if all you do is install APIC-EM and start making API calls, the data you see in those API calls will be rather sparse. APIC-EM will respond to API calls, but the data available in the API has not been populated yet, because you have not yet discovered the network topology. These last few pages of this Learning Lab examine a few ideas to help you through that discovery process. By completing the discovery process, you will reach the equivalent starting point for many of the DevNet APIC-EM labs and sandboxes: a working APIC-EM, with a discovered network topology.
## The Cisco Network Visibility Application
First, Cisco groups a set of core APIC-EM features as a single app called the *Cisco Network Visibility Application*. Basically, the first several icons under the home icon in the APIC-EM GUI are functions of this one application, as shown in the figure. Why mention that fact here? The documentation for those functions is listed in the [administrative guide for the Cisco Network Visibility App](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-5-x/network_visibility/user-guide/b_Cisco_Network_Visibility_User_Guide_1_5_0_x.html), rather than the [administrative guide for the APIC-EM controller](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-5-x/admin/b_apic_em_admin_guide_v_1-5-x.html) itself. So, look to the documentation for the Cisco Network Visibility app for more information about the discovery feature.

## Network Device Discovery Protocols and Mindset
The overarching goal of the device discovery process is for APIC-EM to add details about each networking device to its Network Information Base. Once in the NIB, APIC-EM can show the devices in its topology maps and to include those devices in the data returned by API calls.

For that discovery process to work correctly, you need a working lab network, with specific overhead protocols configured. In fact, your lab network needs to be more like a production network in that regard, at least during the discovery process. For instance, many of us do not bother to configure SNMP, Telnet, or SSH settings in lab devices, but you will need those features for APIC-EM discovery. Another example: you will want all your network devices to be pingable for the discovery process. So, you might need to change your mindset about your lab network. The rest of this intro reviews the features that need to work.

So, plan to configure your lab network with IPv4, so all devices are pingable, with CDP, SNMP, and SSHv2 support. (APIC-EM supports IPv4, but not IPv6, as of the time this lab was released.) The next page details the specifics of the protocols, with sample configurations for IOS-based devices.
