# Installation: Software Download and Installation Docs
To begin, take care of some necessary and important basic tasks: download the software, and find/bookmark the documentation. These tasks are not exciting, but necessary before moving on to the next steps! Plus, the APIC-EM documentation can be a little challenging to find, so this page includes both links and navigation details.
## Downloading APIC-EM
You can navigate to an APIC-EM download page from a couple of directions. First, the [DevNet APIC-EM page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/) lists many great APIC-EM resources, including a docs page. The docs page includes a download link. Or just click here for the [APIC-EM](https://developer.cisco.com/fileMedia/download/ff4eb410-6a49-40b7-ba27-ce4685c54254) download page.

Alternately, navigate to download like you do for any Cisco software, as follows:
1.	Navigate to cisco.com from your browser
2.	Choose Support… downloads from the title menu
3.	Search on “APIC-EM”
4.	Choose a version and download

## DevNet APIC-EM Portal
When installing APIC-EM, and then setting up your home network to use the apps, you will likely want to have several different references handy. The first place to look for those can be the [DevNet APIC-EM page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/). In particular (and as highlighted in this figure), you should bookmark this page, and/or the docs page linked from the header menu. Also, make sure and join in the APIC-EM community as well.

## Installation Docs - Navigation
As for the APIC-EM documentation, you can of course navigate to the documentation like you do for any Cisco product, but finding the right APIC-EM docs can be a challenge. The options to navigate to the APIC-EM docs are not as obvious as the more prominent parts of the Cisco product line. So, it pays to look around and make sure you can find the docs.
### Best Single Link for APIC-EM Documents
First, the easy method: Use this link for the [APIC-EM doc page](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/one-enterprise-network-controller/tsd-products-support-series-home.html) for all releases, and make a bookmark of this page as your launch point. This page has the documentation across all APIC-EM versions.
### Navigating from the Cisco.com Products Tab
If you need to navigate to the documentation, note that you can follow both the Products and Support options at cisco.com, landing at the same APIC-EM product documentation page. Here’s how to do so from the cisco.com “Product” tab:
1.	Open a browser tab to cisco.com
2.	Hover over “Products and Services” from the header menu
3.	From the menu that appears while hovering, click “All Products”
4.	Look for the “Networking” section, and click “Network Management”
5.	Click in the “Network Automation” section to open a page section, and then click on “APIC-EM”
6.	The APIC-EM product documentation page should appear.

The next two figures show the web page at steps 3 and 5, respectively, from the list of steps.

### Navigating from the Cisco.com Support Tab
Alternately, to navigate from the Cisco.com “Support” tab, to reach the same page:
1.	Open a browser to cisco.com
2.	Hover over “Support” from the header menu
3.	From the menu that appears while hovering, click “All Products”
4.	From the left-to-right stacked menus, select:  
 a.	Products  
 b.	Cloud and Systems Management  
 c.	Policy and Automation Controllers  
5.	From the list of products, choose the option for APIC-EM
6.	The APIC-EM product documentation page should appear.

The next two figures show the web pages at steps 3 and 4, respectively.

## Key APIC-EM Documents
For those of you working through your APIC-EM installation with this DevNet Learning Lab, make sure and find the following documents, for the APIC-EM version you are installing:

- [Interactive Deployment Guide](http://demand.cisco.com/APIC-EM_Deploy): A useful document when installing the product.  
- [APIC-EM Installation Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/one-enterprise-network-controller/products-installation-guides-list.html): Also useful for installation-time decisions.  
- [APIC-EM Administrator Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/one-enterprise-network-controller/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html): A classic configuration and administrative guide document, focused on APIC-EM core features that are not part of any of any specific APIC-EM apps.  
- [Network Visibility Application APIC-EM User Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-5-x/network_visibility/user-guide/b_Cisco_Network_Visibility_User_Guide_1_5_0_x.html): A classic configuration and administrative guide for the Network Visibility application, which includes the device discovery features discussed in this DevNet Learning Lab.

Also, because Cisco releases new APIC-EM software frequently, and the types of documents might change, you should look around the documentation for yourself to find any new interesting types of documents.

## Exercise: Find and Bookmark Your Favorite Doc Pages

1.	Open tabs and navigate to the various docs recommended on this page, and then save those bookmarks so you can find them easily while working on the installation.
