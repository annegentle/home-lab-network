# Installation: Home Network Topology
Once you download APIC-EM, and follow the installation process, you will need to answer a series of questions. A few of those questions relate to the network topology and IP addresses to use, which then drives your choices of what static IP routes to add to the APIC-EM server. Those choices begin with some basic topology choices: where to place the APIC-EM server, where to connect its LAN interface(s), and so on. This page works through the more common options.
## Where to Place APIC-EM in Your Home Network Topology
Adding APIC-EM in an enterprise network may take less thought about the network topology as compared to adding APIC-EM in your home lab. In an enterprise, you will simply choose a VLAN and subnet to which to add APIC-EM. Then you will choose an unused IP address to use for APIC-EM, refer to the existing router in that subnet as the default router/gateway, and with little more thought about the layer 3 topology and routing.

In contrast, the networking gear at our homes falls into two categories, which requires that we think more about the topology before going through the APIC-EM installation questions. Once we install APIC-EM, some of the packets sent by APIC-EM may need to flow through one or the other part of the home network. To show that distinction, this lab uses these terms throughout:

- **Family Network**: Not your lab network, but the devices and networking equipment that you use at home to allow Internet access for you and your family’s various devices. This network typically includes a multi-function router connected to the Internet, both wired and wireless LAN features, all to support devices such as desktop and laptop computers, phones and tablets using Wi-Fi, gaming systems, TVs, and the like.

- **Lab network**: The collection of devices that you use for learning and experimentation, and not used to create the family network. If you power off the lab network devices, your Family network still works.

The first big APIC-EM design question – a question that dictates some answers at installation time – is where should you connect the Ethernet NICs on the APIC-EM server? Does it need to be connected to the family network, the lab network, or both? Some of the reasons for connection to both:
- APIC-EM needs Internet access for a few features, so having a path to the Internet is helpful.
- The desktop/laptop computer you want to use to connect with APIC-EM may sit in the family network; if so, you may want APIC-EM to connect to the family network.
- To do anything useful with your lab network devices, APIC-EM must connect to the lab network.

In the long term, you will likely want to connect APIC-EM to both the family and lab networks – the next few design examples show some of the options, which then drive your choice of IP addresses and routes as discussed on the next page of the lab.
## Design 1: Use Two APIC-EM LAN NICs
The APIC-EM installation process prompts you as to whether you want to use each available LAN interface, and if so, what IP address, mask, and routes to use. So, the most obvious topology to connect APIC-EM to both the family and lab network in your home is to use two NICs, as shown in the next figure:

![alt text](/posts/files/01-apic-03-apic-install-discovery/assets/images/apic-3-09.png)

To make this design work, on the family network side, simply connect the correct APIC-EM NIC to the home router. The home router will likely have an integrated switch as well, usually with 4 or 8 switch ports. In effect, the APIC-EM NIC on the family network connects to the same LAN as the laptop and the home router.

On the lab network, you will need to connect APIC-EM to one of the lab switches (SW1 in this example). Then configure that switch port as an access port, and think more about the layer 3 details so that packets can be delivered to/from APIC-EM to any lab devices (as discussed on the next page in this DevNet Learning Lab).

## Design 2: Use One APIC-EM VLAN Trunking
The first design uses two NICs on the server. To avoid using the second NIC, while still getting the benefits of design 1, you could take advantage of the fact that APIC-EM also supports VLAN trunking. Physically, the design is simple, but it helps to think through the steps in a little more detail.

Focusing on the cabling for a moment, a cable connects from one APIC-EM NIC to a lab switch. Additionally, that lab switch (SW1) connects to a switch port on the home router.

As for the VLANs and related logic, the design places the link between the family and lab networks into VLAN 12, with that link as an access port. That is, the Home router/switch has no concept of VLANs in this case. VLAN 11 is then used in the lab. The APIC-EM configuration will enable VLAN trunking and define VLANs 11 and 12.

Note that the IP details related to VLAN 11 will need to match the lab network’s IP addressing, and likewise the IP details related to VLAN 12 will need to match the family network’s IP addressing. The next page of this Learning Lab provides the details.

## Observations about the First Two Designs
The first two example designs connect the APIC-EM server to both the family and lab networks. You could sit at your laptop and access the APIC-EM user interface using the family network. APIC-EM could do all its work to discover and communicate with your lab network using its second interface, whether that is a second physical interface (as in design 1) or a second VLAN (as in design 2).  And you could write/run programs on the laptop in the family network, accessing APIC-EM APIs over the family network, to learn about APIs and programmability with APIC-EM.

At the same time, you probably also want to access the lab network’s devices, often through their consoles. For casual lab users, that may mean that the lab network devices are nearby, and they swap a console cable to the devices as needed. More active home lab users typically add an access server, which is a device what allows the user to telnet to the access server and then be connected to the lab device’s console, as shown in the next figure.

This updated version of design 1 meets our needs to use APIC-EM in a home-based lab, as well as the traditional need to configure networking devices via their consoles. However, it does not create a path to forward IP packets between the family and lab networks. APIC-EM is not intended as a platform to route between the networks, and the access server’s only connections to the lab network are via console cables, which do not route IP packets at all. But we may want to use a design that includes a path for IP packets between the family and lab networks, as shown in design 3.

## Design 3: APIC-EM on the Family Network, with a Routed Path to the Lab
For this final design option, you create connectivity between your family network and lab network as shown in the next figure. Then, in the lab network devices, you need to configure IP addressing and routing so that at least one router has an interface connected to your family network, with an appropriate IPv4 address from the family network’s IP address range.

This design also works well for future network programmability lab learning experiments because many of the functions require IP connectivity between the host running the program (which you may want to leave in the family network) and the device the program is configuring or operating (which may be in the lab network). For example, NETCONF/YANG uses an SSH connection (which requires IP) between the host and the device to be configured. The only design shown on this page that includes that IP connectivity is the most recent design 3.

This design requires more planning and care for layer 3 addressing and routes, given that the networks now connect with an Ethernet link and need to have usable IP routes. The next page in this lab works through some of those details.
