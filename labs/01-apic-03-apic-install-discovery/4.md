# Installation: IPv4 Addresses and Routes
Each of the designs on the previous page of this DevNet Learning Lab will drive you towards some choices during the APIC-EM installation script. In particular:
  1. Which Ethernet interfaces are you using?
  2. What IP address and mask should you use for each?
  3. What default gateway should you use for each, if any?
  4. What additional static IP routes should you add, if any?

This next page in this Learning Lab examine those choices, and ends with an exercise for you to begin planning for your installation.

## IPv4 Addressing on the Family Network
To review terms in this lab, the _family network_ is the part of the network you use to support the devices you and your family use at home – laptops, desktops, TVs, game systems, and so on. The term _lab network_ refers to the traditional set of networking devices that you use for learning and experimentation.

That said, all the example designs on the previous page show one of the APIC-EM NICs in the family network, either as a physical NIC or as part of a VLAN trunk. (For the purposes of discussion, this page will focus on design 1, with two separate physical NICs.) You should treat this APIC-EM interface on the family network as you would for any other host with a statically-defined IP address on that same subnet in the family network, and choose the following settings, as follows:
  1. Choose which server Ethernet NIC to connect to the family network
  1. Choose an available IP address/mask from the family network, for static configuration during APIC-EM installation, as follows:

   * Find the range of DHCP addresses that the DHCP server will assign in your family network. (Note that the multi-function home router on the left of the design figures also serves as the DHCP server).

   * Deduce the range of addresses then allowed for static assignment

   * Reserve a range of static IP addresses to use for lab devices you want to connect to the family lab

   * Choose one IP address to use for the APIC-EM NIC that connects to the family network

   * Also note the subnet mask used in the subnet per the configuration on the family network’s router
  1. Note the family network router’s IP address in that same subnet, for use as a default router setting on the APIC-EM NIC’s IP settings

For instance:
-  Use the Eth0 interface on the server
-  The Home router, as DHCP server, uses a DHCP pool of 192.168.1.150 – 192.168.1.254.
-  The available range for static addresses is 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.149
-  Reserve 192.168.1.110-119 for static addresses having to do with your lab network
-  Note that the home router’s interface uses 192.168.1.1, and mask 255.255.255.0.

## IPv4 Addressing in the Lab Network
For the second physical or VLAN interface into the lab network, you need to think through the addressing and routing in a little more detail.

First, for the addressing, the lab network’s addressing may change over time. For most of us, the family network’s IP addressing does not change much: that is, you use the same subnet, with the same IP address on the router, same address range for the DHCP server, and so on, at least until you need to replace the home router. As a result, you can configure the matching APIC-EM IP configuration for the family network and likely never change it. However, you may decide to change your lab’s IPv4 addressing plan, as well as changing the topology. So, while you can configure the APIC-EM interface connected to the lab today, you need to think about how to deal with changes over time.

One tactic can be to plan to re-configure APIC-EM each time you re-configure the IP addressing in your lab network. After installation, you can repeat the installation script and re-configure such details as interface IP addresses, masks, and routes. (For details, check the [APIC-EM Administrator Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-5-x/admin/b_apic_em_admin_guide_v_1-5-x/b_apic_em_admin_guide_v_1-5-x_chapter_01001.html), and look for the **config_wizard** command.)

Alternately, you can enforce a little discipline on yourself for conventions in your lab network, as follows:
>Always include one special VLAN/subnet in your lab network design so that the APIC-EM configuration can remain the same.

The idea is simple: create an APIC-EM VLAN and matching APIC-EM subnet that, by choice, remain the same over time. When you change your lab network’s configuration and topology, always include the configuration for the APIC-EM VLAN/Subnet, as follows:
- Designate a physical switch and switch port for the connection to an APIC-EM server NIC.
- Document and use one VLAN ID for the APIC-EM VLAN; this VLAN includes the ports connected to the APIC-EM NIC, and one lab router interface (see next figure).
- Document and use one IP subnet (and mask) in the lab network as the APIC-EM subnet. Note the APIC-EM NIC’s IP address, along with the router’s IP address in that same subnet.

For instance: use VLAN 11 and subnet 172.20.11.0/24 for the APIC-EM VLAN and subnet, with 172.20.11.111 for APIC-EM and 172.20.11.1 for the router. Never use them elsewhere at home, either in the family network or the lab network. And no matter how you change your home lab topology and addressing over time, always configure your planned addresses and connect with the same ports. The figure summarizes those same ideas:

## Static Routes in APIC-EM: Two APIC-EM Interfaces
With a typical enterprise deployment, the APIC-EM host can use its default gateway setting, with no further need to think about routing. However, in a design with two APIC-EM interfaces, the APIC-EM server needs to communicate to destinations reachable through routers connected to each interface. Basically, the APIC-EM host needs to know to route Internet traffic out to the family network’s home router, and traffic destined for the lab network to the nearby lab network router.

![alt text](/posts/files/01-apic-03-apic-install-discovery/assets/images/apic-3-15.png)

APIC-EM needs to communicate to hosts in the Internet for a few functions. Those addresses include the entire public IPv4 address space, so it makes sense to use a default gateway setting on the left-side interface (Eth0). With a default gateway set, the APIC-EM host will send packets to the home router, connected to the Internet, when the APIC-EM server has no other route that matches a packet’s destination IP address.

On the interface connected to the lab network (Eth1 in the figure), avoid using a default gateway, and instead configure static routes. Why? Using two default gateway settings would confuse routing, because both are true defaults: that is, they match all packets. Instead, on the interface connected to the lab network, omit the default gateway setting, and add static routes for all the subnets in the lab network.

What static routes should you add for your lab network? That answer is up to you, based on what addresses you use in lab, but if you only use private IP networks in your lab network, you can create three static routes on APIC-EM to cover all your future needs for APIC-EM static routes. The following three prefixes and masks will cover the entire private IPv4 address space:
- 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 (all of private network 10)
- 172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0 (all private networks from 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0)
- 192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 (all private networks from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0)

All these routes would use a next-hop address of the lab router, for instance, R1’s IP address in the figures shown in this Learning Lab.
## Exercise: Plan Your Topology, Addresses, and Gateway/Routes
Now that you have seen most of the major decision points about topology, addressing, and routing, create your plan, as follows:
  1. Choose a design/topology like those shown in this DevNet Learning Lab, or create your own.
  2. Draw the design, leaving space for interface IDs, addresses, and so on.
  3. Label the APIC-EM interfaces for reference, for example, “Eth0” and “Eth1”.
  4. If you plan to use an APIC-EM VLAN/subnet in your lab (a VLAN and subnet that remains the same, even as your lab network addressing changes), choose those values
  5. Complete the following table with addressing information:








Feature | Interface Eth0  | Interface Eth1
------- |---------------  |---------------
Connects to Device/Port:||
Connected device’s VLAN ID ||
APIC-EM Lab VLAN/Subnet, if used | N/A |
Interface IP address/mask ||
Router device name on this subnet ||
Router IP address on this subnet ||
Default gateway setting on APIC-EM interface ||
Static route (prefix/mask/router) ||
Static route (prefix/mask/router) ||
Static route (prefix/mask/router) ||



.

For example, using the information spread over the last few pages of this lab, for the two-interface topology design shown in the figures on this page:

Feature | Interface Eth0 | Interface Eth1
-------|--------------|---------------
Connects to Device/Port: |Home Router, port 2|Lab switch SW1, port Fa0/11
Connected device’s VLAN ID|N/A|VLAN 11
APIC-EM Lab VLAN/Subnet, if used|N/A|VLAN 11, 172.20.11.0/24
Interface IP address/mask|192.168.1.111/24|172.20.11.111/24
Router device name on this subnet|Home|R1
Router IP address on this subnet|192.168.1.1|172.20.11.1
Default gateway setting on APIC-EM interface|192.168.1.1|None
Static route (prefix/mask/router)|None|10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0/172.20.11.1
Static route (prefix/mask/router)|None|172.16.0/255.240.0.0/172.20.11.1
Static route (prefix/mask/router)|None|192.168.0/255.255.0.0/172.20.11.1

Note that the syntax of the static route information, shown in this sample table, is the same syntax used for adding the static routes in the APIC-EM configuration wizard.
