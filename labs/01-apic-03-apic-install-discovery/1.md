# Installing APIC-EM at Home and Discovering Network Devices
### Objective
* Consider key choices to make when using the APIC-EM installation script  
* Review network design options for adding APIC-EM to your home lab  
* Understand the protocols used during device discovery  
* Prepare your home lab networking devices for successful APIC-EM device discovery

##  Install APIC-EM and Discover Your Home Networking Devices
This DevNet Learning Lab serves as the third lab in a Learning Module that walks through various topics related to using APIC-EM in your home lab. This third lab in the module assumes you have worked through the topics in the first two labs, namely that you will install APIC-EM, that you understand the software and hardware options, and that have obtained (or have made plans obtaining) the server hardware to use for running APIC-EM.

This DevNet Learning Lab then focuses on installation and discovery. Why? The DevNet learning tools that have APIC-EM in them - [DevNet Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks) as well as the [DevNet Sandboxes](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/sandbox/) – already have APIC-EM installed and already have a good environment for discovery. This DevNet Learning Lab hopes to remove barriers so that once you decide to act, you can get APIC-EM installed and working in your home lab, including a good network device discovery, so you that can move on to focus on learning about APIC-EM itself and APIC-EM APIs.

Are you still unsure about whether you need to install APIC-EM at home? If so, circle back to the first two labs in the DevNet Learning Module “[Building Your Home Lab for Network Programmability](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-network)” review those issues.

## Two Halves of This Lab
Like most Learning Labs, this lab contains multiple individual web pages. To help you think through the material, think about the lab as two major topics, as follows:
1. APIC-EM Installation Decisions/Design in for a Home Lab
2. APIC-EM Discovery Protocols/Processes and How to Succeed at APIC-EM Discovery

The first half of this DevNet Learning Lab includes several web pages that work through the installation tasks, noting which choices may require a little more thought as compared with adding APIC-EM to your Enterprise network. The goal is to help you be thoughtful about how your home lab installation, and reduce the number of times you need to reinstall APIC-EM to choose the settings you prefer. This section also helps you prepare your network while waiting for that server hardware to arrive.

The second half of the lab works through the APIC-EM discovery process for networking devices. Once you have installed APIC-EM and start the software, the APIC-EM APIs are enabled. However, those APIs have very little interesting data until you have discovered some devices in the network. The last pages in this Learning Lab discuss the protocols (hey, we’re networkers, right!?!), what APIC-EM is doing, what configuration you need on your devices, and all the considerations to make discovery work correctly.
