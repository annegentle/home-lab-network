# Exercise: Assess What You’ve Done So Far
Objectively, how much have you personally learned so far with all these free learning options? The argument made here is to learn as much as you can for free, and then consider whether to add APIC-EM to your home lab. How are you doing on your learning? This exercise asks you to slow down for a moment and do a little self-assessment.

## Check Your Progress on One of Two DevNet Learning Tracks
One easy and useful place to check is to check your progress on one of two overlapping DevNet Learning Tracks. Each Learning Track lists a series of Learning Labs that make sense to do in that sequence. In some cases, a Learning Lab might be useful inside multiple Learning Tracks, so the Learning Tracks overlap. Some of the best foundational APIC-EM programmability labs happen to be part of two overlapping DevNet Learning Tracks, as shown in this figure.

Your job: assess your progress through one or the other of these two DevNet Learning Tracks. To do so, first open the page for a learning track. Then look at the status information on the page, as highlighted with the arrowed lines in the following figure. The highlighted items show information that tells you whether you have never started, started but not finished, or finished a Learning Lab, and when you last used the Learning Lab if you’ve started it.

- The [Network Programmability Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/netprog-eng)    
- The [APIC-EM Programmability Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-beginner)

Once you see the information on the page, wherever you keep your notes about what you are learning for network programmability, make notes as shown in this table. Then make a to-do in your planner on when to come back and do the Learning Labs.

**Status: One DevNet Learning Track**

## Check Your Progress on Using DevNet Sandboxes for APIC-EM
How much have you used the APIC-EM Sandboxes so far? Have you used them enough to find them useful for learning? Have you used them at all?
For those of you who have not yet tried the APIC-EM Sandboxes, either plan a to-do, or take a few minutes just to access one or two Sandboxes. Here are two good starting points:

With the [Always On (Database Only) APIC-EM Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology?c=14ec7ccf-2988-474e-a135-1e90b9bc6caf):   

- Find and bookmark the URI for the APIC-EM Always-On Sandbox. Also note the username/password. Next time, you can just open the URI from your browser and login.
- If you did the Learning Labs for APIC-EM already, you should have Postman installed on your PC. Try to make an API call to the Always-on Sandbox APIC-EM. Save any API calls in their own Postman collection for later reference.


With the Reservation (database only) APIC-EM Sandbox:

- Reserve the Sandbox to use it now (if available), to experience the normal flow of reserving and waiting for setup.
- You access this APIC-EM by first creating a VPN connection to the Sandbox. Work through these details so that you overcome any VPN setup issues, so that you are ready to go when reserving any of the other DevNet Sandboxes.
