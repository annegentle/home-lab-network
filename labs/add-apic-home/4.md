# Other APIC-EM Learning Options
Before moving on, you should know about two other useful free resources, both described briefly on this page.

## Cisco dCloud
The Cisco Demo Cloud, or dCloud, provides a service for demonstrating, experiencing, and learning about some current Cisco products. At its core, dCloud provides lab pods along with scripted demo experiences. Those can be used by Cisco and Channel Partner SEs to demo a Cisco product to a customer, but they can also be used by customers to experience and learn about the product. And it is a free service!

There were not any demos specific to APIC-EM at the time this Learning Lab was released, but you might look there for other related topics, or for demos released after this Learning Lab was released. To learn more about dCloud, and to search for demos and labs, go to:

## Blogs, Communities, and Other Options
You will probably want to track and use a few other resources as well. In particular, Cisco’s Adam Radford of DevNet frequently presents at DevNet events, Cisco Live, as well as writing blog posts and answering community questions about APIC-EM. If you care to learn a lot about APIC-EM and using its APIs, watch for [Adam’s content](https://communities.cisco.com/people/aradford/content)!  The following list provides some links to help you find Adam’s content as well as several other useful sites:
