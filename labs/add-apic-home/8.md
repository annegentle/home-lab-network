#  Lab Networking Devices – Beginning Your Analysis

Of the main three decision points about whether to put APIC-EM into your home lab – APIC-EM software, APIC-EM server hardware, and your lab’s network devices, your planning and decisions related to your lab networking devices will require the most work on your part. The last several pages in this DevNet Learning Lab examine the issues and give you the key parts of the puzzle so that you can begin the work of analyzing your lab gear. After that analysis, you should be able to answer questions like: 

- What devices in my current home lab are good enough to be useful with APIC-EM once installed?
- Where lacking, what could I do to upgrade existing gear to be useful with APIC-EM?
- Where lacking, what other devices that work with APIC-EM could I use to round out my lab?
Answering those questions requires a little more examination than just looking at one list – albeit a long list – of devices compatible with APIC-EM. 

## The Issue of Compatibility
Pause for a moment and think about the long history of Cisco and their networking products. That roughly 30-year history includes a large variety of product areas, many product families in each product area, and countless specific device models.

And then think of the task of creating one software package that centralized control of many of those products, products from over the long history of Cisco, and creating one consistent API to access information about those products.

The goals that drove Cisco to give us APIC-EM were both broad and deep. One way Cisco could have made their job much easier would have been to require all its customers to buy newer gear with later and consistent OS versions – but Cisco did not require that. However, at the same time, if Cisco had attempted to support (and test) all their historical device families for APIC-EM – particularly older devices and OS versions – the product may have never reached the market. Certainly, making APIC-EM support all Cisco products from throughout its history would have been ridiculous.
What does that mean for us when thinking about our networking gear and whether it will work with APIC-EM? Here are some key points which we will explore in the coming pages:

- Cisco publishes lists of compatible hardware and software – that is, hardware and software combinations Cisco believes work with APIC-EM.
- Based on experience, some other non-listed hardware does work for some APIC-EM features and apps
- For home labs, note that many of the older network devices (and therefore cheaper in the used market) are not in APIC-EM’s compatibility lists.

As a result, the devices and software levels listed in the compatibility lists do not include some of the older of the cheaper home lab device options. The figure shows a few of the more common options for enterprise router and switch families.

## Where to Begin Your Own Lab Analysis: Network Visibility Compatibility List
To get started, go ahead and open another browser tab to look at [this document](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/network_visibility/supported-platforms/b_netvis_supported_devices_1-4-x.html#concept_t2v_zff_5y). Search for the section that lists long tables of compatible hardware, just a few pages into the document.
That document details compatibility information about the APIC-EM app called the “Cisco Network Visibility Application”. This app can be a little difficult to find sometimes, because it does not show up as a separate single app in the APIC-EM GUI. In fact, none of the icons in the APIC-EM GUI go by that name. That app name references a few of APIC-EM’s core features, particularly the Discovery and Topology apps, as shown in the figure.

The compatibility list for the Network Visibility App serves as the best baseline list for device compatibility with APIC-EM. Why? Many of the features of APIC-EM apps rely on the topology information discovered by the discovery function, as stored in APIC-EM’s Network Information Database. APIC-EM uses the database as the basis for displaying the topology, as well as for knowing what devices it might operate against for some other apps, like EasyQoS. 

Now back to the question of whether your lab hardware meets requirements. The starting point in that comparison is to look at the devices supported by the APIC-EM Network Visibility Application. Take the list, and then get into each of your devices and check the actual model numbers and OS versions.

## Exercise: Compare Your Gear to the Network Visibility Application Compatibility List
Your first exercise then is somewhat obvious. You want to start answering those questions, and completing some notes akin to the types of information in the following table:



| Lab Device Name | Lab Device Model | Supported? [^2] | If No: Actions that would Make it Compatible? | If No: Possible Replacement Model? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   |   |   |  |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |
|   |   |   |   |   |					
				
[^2]Answers question of whether the device is supported per the APIC-EM Network Visibility App Compatibility List (APIC-EM Version ____).

Before you get started with the work, if you are doing these activities as you move through the lab, here is some advice:

- Find the now-current compatibility list for the Application Visibility and Control app. As you might expect, that document may change for each successive APIC-EM release.
 - Use this link to find the [APIC-EM documentation page](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/one-enterprise-network-controller/tsd-products-support-series-home.html)  
 - Look for documents labelled “Compatibility Information” and/or “Release Notes”.
- The most likely action to make your existing lab gear become compatible would be to upgrade the OS version (IOS, IOS XE, etc.). Don’t forget to check for RAM/Flash requirements (see the [Cisco Feature Navigator](http://www.cisco.com/cfn)). 
- Because you will likely revisit this task a time or two, allow yourself to move on rather than get bogged down trying to figure out whether you can upgrade a single device.
