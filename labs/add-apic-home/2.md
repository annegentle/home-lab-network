# Learning Programmability and APIC-EM with Existing DevNet Learning Labs
If your goal is to learn about APIC-EM, its APIs, and about network programmability using APIC-EM, then installing APIC-EM at home is probably your fourth or fifth step in that process. You should start by learning what you can using other free tools, and then deciding whether you want to install it in your home lab. For some people, you may learn all you care to learn without taking the time and expense to install APIC-EM at home.

Simple enough.

So, the first step in thinking about adding APIC-EM to your home lab is to think about whether you need to bother or not. The next page of this Learning Lab details some of those learning options in case you’ve not seen them before.

## Network Programmability Learning Track
DevNet organizes many of the Learning Labs into learning tracks. Each Learning Track groups related Learning Labs, and orders them in a useful sequence.

For instance, the Network Programmability Learning Track has several APIC-EM labs. To see the various Learning Tracks:
1.	Browse to Developer.cisco.com
2.	Choose the top menu item “Discover”, and choose “Learning Tracks”

That process should navigate your browser to a page similar to the one shown in the next figure, from which you could select the Network Programmability Learning Track.

## All APIC-EM Labs
<<<<<<< HEAD
You can also navigate to any DevNet Learning Lab directly, ignoring the Learning Tracks. For instance, to find labs tagged as having some APIC-EM content, you can browse to [learninglabs.cisco.com/labs]( https://learninglabs.cisco.com/labs) and then either:
1. Type “APIC-EM” in the search box in the upper right
1. Click category “APIC-EM” on the left

## What You Get with Existing DevNet Learning Labs about APIC-EM
<<<<<<< HEAD
Each of these DevNet Learning Labs gives you a sequence of scripted steps to help you learn something useful, typically in around 20 minutes. Think of them like lab exercises in a class, but also with enough material from the course to go along with the lab activities so that you can do the lab by yourself without any help.

Some of the strengths of the Learning Labs are:

- **Always On:** Some of the Learning Labs (and many of the labs about APIC-EM) use an Always-on Sandbox Lab, so that you can do the lab any time, without a need to schedule them.
- **Interact from Your Own PC:** Many Learning Labs will have you install some tools on your own home computer (which is great for learning)
- **Uses DevNet Sandbox Labs:** Note that Learning Labs – that is, the lab exercises often use DevNet Sandbox Labs – that is, pods of real/virtual/simulated network device instances – as the lab network on which to perform the lab exercise. (More on DevNet Sandbox Labs coming next!)
