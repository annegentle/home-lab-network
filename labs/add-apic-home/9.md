# APIC-EM’s Myriad Compatibility Lists
In some ways, APIC-EM is an application, but in others, it is a platform for applications. When thinking about your lab gear, and whether it is compatible with APIC-EM, you should think about it in terms of apps, and what that compatibility gives you. This page explores some of the apps and their compatibility lists.

The main point is that each app may (and often does) have its own list of compatible hardware and software. In some cases, the lists are close to the list for the Network Visibility app’s compatibility list, while in other cases the subset is much smaller. The lists are subsets of the lists seen for the Network Visibility app, as depicted in this figure.

This page works through some of the reasons.

##  Path Trace Application

The Path Trace Application allows the user to supply a source and destination, with the application then showing the path a packet would take from that source to the destination. In the GUI, Path Trace creates a linear drawing with the source on the left and the destination on the right.

The app has its own list of compatible hardware and software. First, this app relies on the Network Information Database as discovered by the APIC-EM Network Visibility Application. Then, it examines the forwarding tables of the actual devices in the network, predicting what entries would be matched by those tables.

As it turns out, this app’s list of compatible devices closely matches the list of devices supported by the Network Visibility Application. Many of the same devices are listed, but with more recent OS versions. Check this [link ](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/path_trace/supported-platforms/b_path_Supported_Platforms_1_4_0_x.html)
to find the compatibility list for this app, as of the time this Learning Lab was posted.

##  EasyQoS App


The EasyQoS application, like the Path Trace application, has its own separate compatibility list. The list is again a close replica of the list for the Network Visibility application, with different details. 

The app deploys QoS configurations to devices, based on Cisco’s best practices per Cisco’s QoS Design Guides. As a result, the QoS app omits a few devices (for example, ASA firewalls) found in the compatibility lists for the Path Trace and Network Visibility apps. It also lists some extra details – for instance, while few of you will likely have Cisco 6500 or 6800 switches in your home lab, note that the compatibility document does detail support by line card in those switches, because QoS features can differ in different line cards.

Check out the [compatibility guide for the APIC-EM EasyQoS app](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/easyqos/supported-platforms/b_EasyQoS_Supported_Devices_1_4_0_x.html#concept_t2v_zff_5y) for more specifics.   


## Intelligent WAN (IWAN) App
Intelligent WAN, or [IWAN](http://www.cisco.com/go/iwan ), creates a Software-Defined WAN (SD-WAN) solution. It uses several Cisco product features, which makes the configuration a bit challenging at times. The IWAN app helps solve that problem by helping you configure IWAN features by using a series of configuration panels from the IWAN app GUI.

The list of supported devices for the IWAN app is more a statement of what platforms and OS versions support the IWAN features. For instance, the following documents include the list of compatible devices for IWAN 2.2 and then for the APIC-EM IWAN app (V1.4.x). If you put them side-by-side, you’ll see that the supported device list for the IWAN feature is the same list as the supported devices for the APIC-EM IWAN app.

## Impact on Your Home Lab Analysis
Remember that original set of questions about your home lab gear? Armed with this kind of information, you need give some thought to what parts of APIC-EM are most compelling to you. If you get APIC-EM working so that discovery works, is that enough for you? In that case, the topology and device parts of the API should work, which lets you practice some API calls. Or if you also want Path Trace, and/or the EasyQoS app and its APIs available, how does your lab gear stack up?

To answer those questions, you should first find any updated compatibility lists as follows:

- Navigate to the [APIC-EM documentation](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/one-enterprise-network-controller/tsd-products-support-series-home.html).   
- Find the documents for the latest version of APIC-EM.
- Open new browser tabs for both the “Compatibility Information” and “Release Notes” categories; some apps list their compatibility info in release notes, some in the compatibility docs.

Now you have some work to do, as outlined in this closing exercise.

## Exercise: Assess Your Lab Gear Vs. APIC-EM Apps
For this exercise, you will again probably do some work, and then come back to revisit again as you work to prepare your lab. So, find a place to take your notes where you will not lose the notes later. Here are some suggested steps:

- Think about the existing APIC-EM apps, and decide which you must support in your home lab, which you would like to support, and which are just nice to have
- Make a table list the table below, listing the apps
- Find the compatibility list for each of the apps you care about
- Work through each of the devices in your lab, and determine if it is in the compatibility list, or if with an upgrade, it could meet the requirements of the compatibility list.
