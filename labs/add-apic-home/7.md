# Software: APIC-EM in Your Home Lab
The best news about adding APIC-EM to your home lab is that you can download APIC-EM for free, fully licensed. This page walks through the basics, but literally, you could be downloading all the software you need with about five minutes of navigating at Cisco.com.

##  Downloading APIC-EM Software

Cisco delivers APIC-EM software as a disk image – an [ISO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image) – that you download from Cisco’s support site. As a result, the process is simple: You find the latest release (or the release that you want), click a few times, and wait while the large file downloads.

As for the version to download, the right answer will vary over time. So far, Cisco has released about three new versions of APIC-EM per year. Additionally, some Beta versions of different apps may appear over time as well. So, if unsure of a good version to use, you might try asking in the DevNet APIC-EM forum for recommendations. However, given that you are installing it in a home lab, you can just pick the latest release that is clearly not a Beta version of the code.

You can get to the download page by:

1.	Navigating to cisco.com from your browser
2.	Choosing Support… downloads from the title menu
3.	Searching on “APIC-EM”

The next figure shows a copy of an APIC-EM download. Of note, the user had clicked for version 1.4 on the left, which revealed the list of downloadable images on the right. The user was hovering over one image, causing a pop-up window to give more detail. Of course, clicking the download button on the right initiates the download.

##  APIC-EM Apps and Licenses
The APIC-EM ISO, to date, includes most of the apps. That is, you download the ISO, install from the ISO, and most all the apps are installed as part of the process. These included apps, called Basic Apps in Cisco’s licensing documents, are licensed and require no action on your part. The figure shows the Basic Apps available as part of the APIC-EM 1.4.x releases:

## A Brief Word on the IWAN App

For licensing purposes, Cisco categorizes APIC-EM apps as: 

- Basic Apps
- Solutions Apps

The basic apps ship with the APIC-EM ISO and require no license. The solutions apps do require licensing to be used legally. The one Solution App so far (as of APIC-EM 1.4.x) is the IWAN app. (Note that you can separately download the IWAN app from the same download pages.)

This Learning Lab does not get into the detail of the licensing on the IWAN app, in part because there is much to the story, and that story has much more to do with IWAN than APIC-EM. However, here are some good references if you care to read more:

##  Exercise: Download APIC-EM ISO and Signature File
If you are marching towards APIC-EM installation, you may as well go ahead and download two key files, even before getting into the planning process. Here are some quick steps:

- Go to the download site [here](https://developer.cisco.com/fileMedia/download/ff4eb410-6a49-40b7-ba27-ce4685c54254).  
- Find the latest generally-available release (or choose your preferred release)
- Download the ISO file (probably in the 4 GB size range or more)
- Also download the matching signature file
- Once downloaded, set these two files aside in a directory where you can find them once you begin the installation process.
