# A Bit More about Python Commands

Python commands in this lab should work on your computer even when using Python 2.7 and Python 3.x on your computer. However, Python includes more commands and command parameters that you may see in other DevNet Learning Labs, web sites, and books. This last page provides information about other commands with some references for reading.

## The Windows py Command Versus the python Command

This lab uses a Python for Windows feature called the Python Launcher because you start Python on Windows using the **py** command in this lab. The [Python Launcher](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/) **py** command applies rules so that the system chooses the correct instance of Python to execute on the Windows machine, among all the installed instances. The Python Launcher is designed to solve the problem of the OS deciding which Python to use when multiple versions are installed.

One way to use the Windows Python Launcher is to pass the **-2** and **-3** options to the **py** command. These options execute the default Python version 2 or version 3 interpreter on that OS, respectively. If you install only one version of Python 2.7, remember to use the **py -2** **...** command. Likewise, to start that one Python 3.x version that is installed, use the **py -3** **...** command.

At the same time, you could use the **python** command on Windows. The Python installation process installs an executable named **python**. Interestingly, the **python** command on Windows executes the most recently installed version of Python. So, which version of Python runs when you use the **python** command? To find out, type the **python** command and look at the version displayed as the interactive interpreter session begins or use the **python –V** command to list the version.

There is more to know beyond these basics. For more information, check out [this doc page about how to install and use Python on Windows](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html).

## Other Linux and Mac Python Commands

On Linux and Mac, if you stay with the approach of one Python 2.7 version and one Python 3.x version, keep using the **python** and **python3** commands used throughout this lab. That said, there are more options!

As an example, Python on Linux and OS X include a command for each major release. That is, there is a **python2.7** command, **python3.5** command, **python3.6** command, and so on. So, if you want to install one release of Python 3.5 and one release of Python 3.6 on the same Linux or Mac host, you could call each with the **python3.5** and **python3.6** commands.

## Virtual Environments

If you wonder if this whole install-multiple-versions-of-Python mess is worth the effort, take heart. Here are two suggestions.

First, if you are getting started with Python, then install either 2.7 or 3.6, and get some experience. Let your learning process over time indicate when you add the other major version, and stick with that pair of versions. In other words, keep it simple.

Second, learn about and use virtual environments, even as a beginner using Python. Python virtual environments set up and re-use a Python environment. No matter how many Python releases you install, that virtual environment uses the specific Python version and release decided when you create the virtual environment. Plus, setup is one command, and using the virtual environment each time is a single command. And when using a virtual environment, use the **python** command to run that one version/release of Python defined in that virtual environment, with no worries about which of the many Python versions on your system that it is using.

We have more info about virtual environments! The next lab in this DevNet Learning Module, “Home Lab: Python Libraries (PIP) and Virtual Environments”, works through the details.
