# Summary

At heart, this lab shows how to install and use Python, on your own computer, so that you understand how to be ready to run Python programs with both the older Python 2.7 as well as the new 3.x versions. Hopefully, the approach that goes beyond just asking you to run the installation process will make you better prepared to run Python on your own, reduce mistakes, and be productive in your home lab.

The next lab in this DevNet Learning Module keeps the focus on Python running on your home computerâ€™s OS. Specifically, the next lab examines two key topics. The next lab begins with PIP, which is a tool to install and manager Python libraries, and it ends with virtual environments, which is a tool with many benefits to both novice and experienced Python users.
