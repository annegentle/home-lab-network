# Installing and Verifying Python 3.x

The installation process for Python 3.x works generally the same for each respective OS type as described on the previous page. This next page reminds you of a few details, and points out some operational differences assuming you have installed both Python 2.7 and 3.x on your PC.

## Linux and Mac – Like Two Separate Python Interpreters

On both Linux and Mac, you call Python version 3 with the **python3** command, with the **python** command used for python version 2. As a result, you can easily install both, and use one or the other just based on the command you choose to run.

Just as with Python V2.7, for Python 3.x, you can install using a package manager, or download from Python.org and install. As with the Python 2.7 installation process, take a moment to check the available releases via download and your package manager. For instance:

-   From any web browser, check the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) downloads page to find the most recent release of Python 3.x. (You can download the most recent release, or earlier releases as well.)

-   From a command shell, check the releases available with your package manager:

    -   For example, with apt, use the **sudo apt show python3** command, which lists details about the python package per the apt index.

    -   On Mac, use the **brew list python3** command.

To install using a package manager, use the usual commands, but with a package name of “python3” instead of “python”. In this case:

-   (Linux apt): the **sudo apt install** **python3** command.

-   (Mac Homebrew): the **brew install** **python3** command.

## Installing Python 3.x on Windows

Installing Python 3.x follows the same general process as for a Python 2.7 install, but poses a few more challenges for running both old and new code once installed. To install, just as before, browse [python.org](http://www.python.org/) to find the [Python 3.x installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for the version you want to install, download the installer file, and execute the installer. Again, make sure to check the box to add Python to the execution path on your computer.

Once you have installed both Python 2.7 and 3.x, Windows will run the Python 3.x interpreter by default when you use the **py** command. The **py** command, defined for Windows as a method for the Python interpreter to decide whether to interpret a program as V2.x or V3.x, can be told directly whether to use version 2 or 3. For example:

**py -v2  my-v2-program.py**

**py -v3  my-v3-program.py (**or **py my-v3-program.py)**



## Verifying Your Python Installation Yet Again

Just to make sure, take a few moments to repeat the usual verification steps, completing one of these two tables.
