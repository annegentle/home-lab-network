# Installing and Verifying Python 3.x

The installation for Python 3.x works the same for each operating system as described previously. This page provides a few details and points out some operational differences when you have both Python 2.7 and 3.x installed.

## Linux and Mac – Like Two Separate Python Interpreters

On both Linux and Mac, you call Python version 3 with the **python3** command and use the **python** command to call Python version 2. As a result, you can easily install both and indicate one or the other with the command you type to run.

Just as with Python 2.7, for Python 3.x, you can install using a package manager or download from Python.org and install. As with the Python 2.7 installation process, take a moment to check the available releases via download and your package manager. For instance:

-   From any web browser, check the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org) downloads page to find the most recent release of Python 3.x. (You can download the most recent release, or earlier releases as well.)

-   From a command shell, check the releases available with your package manager:

    -   For example, with apt, use the **sudo apt show python3** command, which lists details about the python package per the apt index.

    -   On Mac, use the **brew list python3** command.

To install using a package manager, use the usual commands, but with a package name of “python3” instead of “python”. In this case:

-   (Linux apt): the **sudo apt install** **python3** command.

-   (Mac Homebrew): the **brew install** **python3** command.

## Installing Python 3.x on Windows

Installing Python 3.x follows the same general process as for a Python 2.7 install, but poses a few more challenges for running both old and new code once installed. To install, just as before, browse [python.org](http://www.python.org/) to find the [Python 3.x installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for the Python version you want to install. Download the installer file and execute the installer, and make sure to check the box to add Python to the execution path on your computer.

When both Python 2.7 and 3.x are installed, Windows runs the Python 3.x interpreter by default when you use the **py** command. You can tell the Python interpreter on Windows whether to use version 2 or 3 when issuing the **py** command. For example:

**py -v2  my-v2-program.py**

**py -v3  my-v3-program.py (**or **py my-v3-program.py)**

## Verifying Your Python Installation Yet Again
