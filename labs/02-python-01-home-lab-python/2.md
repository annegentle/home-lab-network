# Related DevNet Learning Resources

This DevNet Learning Lab focuses on the tools you need in your home lab, specifically for your favorite desktop operating system (OS), whether Windows, Linux, or Mac. However, before focusing on those tools, this page examines some of the related resources at DevNet, particularly DevNet Learning Labs and DevNet Sandboxes.

## Using a PC’s Python Tools with DevNet

Your home lab’s desktop OS should be able to work with most of the DevNet resources, as well as working with the networking devices in your home lab. For example, most DevNet Learning Labs that include Python require you to use your own desktop OS to run Python, as shown in item 1 in the next figure. You first open the DevNet Learning Lab in a web browser, but then the lab steps ask you to take some steps, with the lab sometimes having you use a DevNet Sandbox. For the Python programming tasks, you will run Python on your PC, with the lab exercise telling you exactly what you need to install and use on your PC to do the lab exercise.

As shown in item 2 in the figure, a DevNet Sandbox Lab provides you with some lab pod for use, but again, most of the lab pods today expect that any Python programming happens on your PC. In that case, the Sandbox Lab documentation does not tell you what Python tools to install and use on your desktop OS. The Sandbox documentation focuses on what is supplied in the Sandbox Lab. It is up to you to know what you need on your PC to make good use of the Sandbox. Comparing the two, the Learning Labs give you scripted guidance, and the Sandbox Labs give you a place to play.

Of course, you can install and configure many programming tools on your desktop OS and then use those with your own lab gear in your home lab!

In some cases, most often in some [DevNet Event](http://devnetevents.cisco.com/), or when using [Cisco dCloud](http://dcloud.cisco.com/), you may do the Python programming on a virtualized desktop OS instance, rather than on your own computer in your home lab. In that case, the remote lab pod includes OS instances, with Python installed, and a collection of tools. You use a Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) tool from your own computer to take control of the desktop OS in the lab. In that case, you need to be ready to understand the tools used by the labs at the event or in the demo you are working through.

(By the way, you should keep an eye out for [DevNet Express Events](http://devnetevents.cisco.com/) coming your way – they are great learning opportunities!)

## Some Relevant DevNet Learning Labs

You should keep working towards setting up your home lab for network programmability. At the same time, what are some good DevNet Learning Labs to help you review and learn about the tools on your PC, particularly those discussed in this Learning Lab? The best single place to look is the [Introduction to DevNet Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-beginner).

The Introduction to DevNet Learning Track provides the single best place to get started with Python on your own computer for a couple of reasons. First, this learning track includes labs about Python itself, as well as labs focused on two different APIs: Spark and APIC-EM. The track includes four modules with about 20 total labs, but you can pick and choose from the Learning Track page.

Of course, because many of the DevNet Learning Labs ask you to use your own desktop OS to perform different tasks, many will revisit the use of Python (which is the primary topic of this Learning Lab).
