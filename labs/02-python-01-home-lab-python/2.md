# Related DevNet Learning Resources

While this lab focuses on the tools you need on your desktop operating system (OS), you should also examine related resources at DevNet, particularly DevNet Learning Labs and DevNet Sandboxes.

## Using Local Python Tools with DevNet

Your home lab’s desktop should work with DevNet resources plus work with the networking devices in your home lab. For example, most DevNet Learning Labs that include Python require your desktop OS to run Python, as shown in item 1 in the next figure. You open the DevNet Learning Lab in a web browser, and then run steps in the lab, sometimes using a DevNet Sandbox. For the Python programming tasks you run Python locally, and the lab steps provide exactly what you need to install and use on your desktop to do the lab exercise.

As shown in item 2 in the figure, a DevNet Sandbox Lab provides a lab pod but the Python programming happens on your PC. The Sandbox Lab documentation focuses on what is supplied in the Sandbox Lab and does not tell you what Python tools to install and use on your desktop. You need to know what to install locally to make use of the Sandbox. Comparing the two, the Learning Labs give you scripted guidance, and the Sandbox Labs give you a place to play.

You can install and configure many programming tools on your desktop and then use those with your home lab gear.

In some [DevNet Events](http://devnetevents.cisco.com/), or when using [Cisco dCloud](http://dcloud.cisco.com/), the Python programming occurs on a virtualized desktop instance rather than your local desktop. In that case, the remote lab pod includes OS instances with Python installed and a collection of tools. You use a Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) tool from your computer to take control of the desktop OS in the lab. In any scenario, understand the tools used by the labs at the event or in the demo you are working through.

(By the way, you should keep an eye out for [DevNet Express Events](http://devnetevents.cisco.com/) coming your way – they are great learning opportunities!)

## Some Relevant DevNet Learning Labs

Keep working towards setting up your home lab for network programmability. At the same time, to help you review and learn about the tools on your computer, what are the related Learning Labs? The best place to look is the [Introduction to DevNet Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-beginner).

The Introduction to DevNet Learning Track provides instructions to get started with Python on your own computer. This learning track includes labs about Python itself, as well as labs focused on two different APIs: Spark and APIC-EM. The track includes four modules with about 20 total labs, and you can pick and choose from the Learning Track page.

Because many of the DevNet Learning Labs use your own desktop OS to perform different tasks, many Labs revisit the use of Python, which is the primary topic of this Learning Lab.
