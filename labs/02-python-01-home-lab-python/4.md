# Verifying the Existing Python on Your PC

If you plan to do a lot with network programmability, you will probably use Python as your primary language. You may need to begin with installing Python, and maybe work to upgrade it. The next few pages of this Learning Lab work through some of those key steps: discovering what Python interpreter you may have already installed, installing Python (both 2.7 and 3.x), and then verifying that you can use the Interpreter once installed.

## Python Interpreter

The [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) oversees the long-term development of the Python Language. However, the language itself is just that – a language – rather than software. To run a Python program (also called a script) on your computer, you need some Python software – a Python interpreter – that implements Python on your computer. The Python interpreter will read your Python program, interpret the meaning of each line of code, make sure it follows the Python syntax rules, and if so, do what the Python statement directs. (In other words, Python programs are interpreted, and not compiled.)

Many Python interpreters exist. You could search the Internet and choose to install your choice among those Python Interpreters. Realistically though, most of us will go pretty far in learning about network programmability using the Python interpreter comes from Python.org, as shown in the figure.

## Python Versions

Part of the work done by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) includes managing the process of adding new feature updates and new Python versions for the Python language, using documents called [Python Enhancement Proposals](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) (PEPs). (You networkers can think of these as RFCs for Python.) To go along with the changes to the language, the PSF releases new versions of their Python interpreter, with each new version including a series of new features per a list of PEPs.

The PSF moved Python through a major version release, from Python 2 to Python 3, beginning around 2008 with the first release of a Python 3.x version (Version 3.0). That major version change contained mostly internal changes, with many of the Python statements kept the same syntax. As a result, when learning Python, you may not notice version differences between programs written for Python 2 versus Python 3. ([Look to this page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) for more details about the differences between the two major versions.)

Today, if starting out, you can choose whether to use a recent release of Python 2, Python 3, or both. If it was totally up to you, then I’d suggest just using Python 3. However, you may find plenty of courses, lab exercises, and books that ask you to use Python 2, and they may supply Python code that requires Python 2. So, you will likely want to have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed and working on your PC, and thankfully, it is relatively easy to have both handy.

Note that Python 2.7 is the final Python Version 2 release to have new features added, with only bug fixes added to minor releases of Python 2.7. The first 2.7 release (2.7.0) occurred back in the year 2010, with the most recent version as of the time this lab was posted (2.7.13) being released in 2017. Python 3.x has seen seven major versions (3.0 through 3.6) since version 3.0’s release back in 2008.

## Exercise: Checking Your Current Python Version(s)

Take a few moments to do a check of your system to discover what Python version(s) you have installed, if any. To do so, open a command prompt/command shell, and type the commands shown in the two upcoming tables. Note that the commands are identical on Mac and Linux, while on Windows, you need to use slightly different commands. By the end of issuing these commands, you should know if you have at least some Python 2 and/or Python 3 installed, and in what directory the Python interpreter executable file is installed (found with the **which** or **where** command, respectively.)

On Linux and OS X, note that you run (execute) the Python 2 interpreter with the **python** command, and the Python 3 interpreter with the **python3** command, making the results pretty obvious.

For instance, Apple has included some recent Python 2.7 in all the recent OS X releases, but they still do not include a Python 3.x version. If you have not yet installed Python 3 on your Mac, then the **python3** command should simply be rejected with a message like “command not found”, and the **which python3** command should show that the executable cannot be found. However, many recent Linux builds include both Python 2 and Python 3.
