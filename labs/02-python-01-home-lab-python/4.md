# Verifying the Existing Python on Your PC

If you plan to do a lot with network programmability, Python is a likely primary language. You begin with detecting or installing a Python version, and perhaps upgrading. This Learning Lab works through key steps: discovering if a Python interpreter is installed, installing Python (both 2.7 and 3.x), and then verifying that you can use the Interpreter.

## Python Interpreter

The [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) (PSF) oversees the long-term development of the Python language. However, the language itself is just that – a language – rather than software. To run a Python program (also called a script) on your computer, you need Python software – a Python interpreter – that implements Python on your computer. The Python interpreter reads your Python program, interprets the meaning of each line of code, makes sure it follows the Python syntax rules, and if so, do what the Python statement directs. In other words, Python programs are interpreted, and not compiled.

Many Python interpreters exist, though most of us can learn network programmability using the Python interpreter comes from Python.org, as shown in the figure.

## Python Versions

Part of the work done by the [Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/) includes managing the process of feature updates and new Python versions for the Python language, using documents called [Python Enhancement Proposals](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) (PEPs). Networkers can think of these as RFCs (Requests for Comments) for Python. To provide incremental changes to the language, the PSF releases new versions of their Python interpreter. Each new version includes a series of new features per a list of PEPs.

In 2008, the PSF moved Python through a major version release from Python 2 to Python 3 with the first release of a Python 3.x version, 3.0. That major version change contains mostly internal changes, and many Python statements kept the same syntax. When learning Python, you may not notice differences between programs written for Python 2 versus Python 3. [Look to this page](https://wiki.python.org/moin/Python2orPython3) for more details about the differences between the two major versions.

You can choose whether to use a recent release of Python 2, Python 3, or both. In environments you control, I’d suggest using Python 3. However, you may find courses, lab exercises, and books that use Python 2 and supply Python 2 code. So, you want to install both Python 2 and Python 3 on your desktop and keep both versions handy.

Note that Python 2.7 is the final Python Version 2 release to have new features added. Only bug fixes are added to minor releases of Python 2.7. In 2010 the first 2.7 release (2.7.0)became available, and in late 2017 the most recent version is 2.7.14. Python 3.x has seen seven major versions (3.0 through 3.6) since version 3.0’s release in 2008 and the current version is 3.6.4.

## Exercise: Checking Your Current Python Version(s)

Check your system to discover what Python version(s) you have installed, if any. To do so, open a command prompt and type the commands shown in the two tables below. The commands are identical on Mac OS X and Linux. On Windows you use different commands. After issuing these commands, you know if you have a version of Python 2 or Python 3 installed, and in what directory the Python interpreter is installed, found with the **which** or **where** command depending on your desktop operating system.

On Linux and Mac OS X, you run the Python 2 interpreter with the **python** command, and the Python 3 interpreter with the **python3** command, making the versions in use obvious.

Apple has included some recent Python 2.7 in all the recent Mac OS X releases, but they do not yet include a Python 3.x version. If you have not installed Python 3 on your Mac, then issuing the **python3** command returns a message like “command not found”. Also the **which python3** command shows that the executable cannot be found. However, many recent Linux builds include both Python 2 and Python 3.
