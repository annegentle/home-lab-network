# Running Python Programs

As a quick exercise, make sure you can start the Python interpreter, both using interactive mode and by passing your program as a file. You will do both on this page, and in each case, you will confirm the Python version you are using. These brief exercises give you one last step to check your work before looking at Python Libraries.

## Command Reference

Just for handy reference, this table lists the commands you should use start the Python interpreter from a command prompt, for each OS. Alternately, you can use the same commands, and list the filename at the end, to interpret a program that you have edited into a file.

## Brief Intro: Differences in Print and Division

This exercise uses two differences between Python 2 and 3 to show the differences when testing.

First, Python 2 uses the **print** statement syntax that looks like a statement rather than a function, that is, it does not use parenthesis around the parameters, but instead uses quotes. For instance, the following two statements both print some text, one with the correct original V2.x syntax, the second with V3.x syntax:

  V2: **print 'Hello World'**

  V3: **print('Hello World')**

(Note that the Python 2 interpreter will accept both the Python 2 and Python 3 syntax for the **print** statement, but the Python 3 interpreter rejects the use of the old Python 2 syntax.)

Second, Python 3 uses different rules about division of integers as compared to Python 2. The idea is simple: In real life, 3/2 (that is, 3 divided by 2) equals 1.5. In Python 2.x, the assignment **a = 3/2** assigns the value 1 to variable a. Python 2 sees both numbers in the “3/2” as integers, and makes the resulting value an integer, and then rounds down to 1, leaving variable a’s assigned value as integer 1. Python 3 makes sees the same math, makes the result is a floating-point value, sets a’s data type to floating point, and a’s value to 1.5.

The print statement and integer division can be good examples of proving whether you are using Python 2.x or 3.x. Now on to a sample!

## Exercise: Interactively Run Python 2 Code in Python 2 and 3 Interpreters

For this next exercise, you will start Python 2 and 3 in two separate windows, and copy/paste some sample code into interactive Python interpreter sessions to see the differences.

1.  Open two terminal windows/command shells and put them side-by-side.

2.  Start the Python 2 interpreter in the left-side window per the command table on this page.

    1.  Notice that the Python version is displayed in the messages when the interpreter starts.

    2.  Issue the statements: **import sys** and then **sys.version**. Does the version match what the interpreter just mentioned when it started?

3.  Start the Python 3 interpreter in the right-side window, and likewise note the version when it starts, and with the same two statements issued.

4.  Leave the two windows and interpreter sessions open.

At this point, you should be convinced that you are running an interactive Python 2 interpreter session in your left-side window, and a Python 3 session in your right-side window.

Next, do some testing of a Python 2 program, pasted into the Python 2 interpreter first, and later into the Python 3 interpreter, as follows:

1.  Copy/paste the Python 2 sample program below into the Python 2 interpreter. You should see:

    1.  The **print** statements, using Python 2 syntax, perform correctly.

    2.  The division, which results in 1.5 real life, is shown as “1”, with variable a as an integer variable.

2.  Before copying this same Python 2 program into your Python 3 interpreter, think about the **print** statements and variable a. What do you expect to happen with those statements?

3.  Copy/paste this same Python 2 program into the Python 3 interpreter. You should see:

    1.  The print statements should be rejected with a Syntax Error exception

    2.  The assignment of variable a, to the result of the calculation of 3/2, should be set to 1.5, with a as a floating-point variable.

4.  Leave the two windows and interpreter sessions open.

#### Sample Python 2 Program

```
import sys
print 'Hello World'
print sys.version
a = 3/2   # In Python 2, a is integer, rounded down
print a
print(type(a))
print 'I think this interpreter is 2.x'
```

## Exercise: Interactively Run Python 3 Code in Python 2 and 3 Interpreters

This last exercise on the page follows the same basic flow as the previous exercise: two windows, one with the Python 2 interpreter, one with the Python 3 interpreter, but this time testing with some Python 3 code.

1.  Copy/paste the Python 3 sample program below into the Python 3 interpreter on the right. You should see:

    1.  The **print** statements, using Python 3 syntax, perform correctly

    2.  The division, which results in 1.5 real life, is shown as “1.5”, with variable a as a floating-point variable

2.  Before copying this same Python 3 program into your Python 2 interpreter, think about the **print** statements and variable a. What do you expect to happen with those statements?

3.  Copy/paste this same Python 3 program into the Python 2 interpreter. You should see:

    1.  The **print** statements should work, because Python 2.7 will accept the newer Python 3 syntax with parenthesis.

    2.  The assignment of variable a, to the division of 3/2, should be set to 1, with a as an integer variable.

#### Sample Python 3 Program

```
import sys
print('Hello World') # this line would work in 2.7 as well
print(sys.version)
a = 3/2 # In Python 3, a is floating point 1.5
print(a)
type(a)
print('I think this interpreter is 3.x')
```

### (H3) Optional Exercise: Repeat the Experiments with the Programs in a File

As an optional exercise, take the time to execute one of these sample Python programs from a file. That is, open a text editor, and copy/paste either of the sample programs into the file. Save the file, and then call the correct Python interpreter, passing the filename of the file. Note that when you do so, you will either need to move the command shell’s current directory to be the directory where the file is stored, or to list the full file path in the command.

For instance, after copy/pasting the sample Python 3 program to a file name WOSample03.py, and using the **cd** command to move to the directory where the program is stored, the following shows the use of the **python3 WOSample03.py** command on a Mac to interpret the Python program.
