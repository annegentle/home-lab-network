## Objectives

Completion Time: 30 minutes

By the end of this lab, you can:

-   Describe the basic types of tools you need on your computer to use Python to learn network programmability.
-   Run the interactive interpreter for both Python 2.7 and 3.x on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
-   Execute both Python 2.7 and 3.x programs on your computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)

## Prerequisites
To perform this DevNet Learning Lab, you need:

-   One (or more) personal devices (Windows, Mac, or Linux), with access rights to install new software (for instance, you need administrator access for some installation steps).
-   Internet access
-   Basic skills with one desktop OS (Windows, Linux, Mac)

## Intro

To learn a Command Line Interface (CLI) on various Cisco networking devices, think about tools on your desktop. You don’t need many tools: install a terminal emulator, connect a console cable to a networking device, and start learning all those CLI commands. Or, install a Telnet/SSH client application, and focus on the CLI.

Learning about network programmability requires more tools on your desktop, many that come from the software development world. When working through a learning exercise, the tool itself might not be the point of the exercise. The user can install the tool quickly as a task to complete before getting back to the main topic in the exercise. For instance, if you are using a DevNet Learning Lab that tells you to run a Python version 3 program, and you do not have Python 3 installed, you might quickly install Python 3, ignoring any details other than those required to get it working.

This learning lab, and some others in the same [DevNet Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/home-lab), take a step back from that hectic pace to focus more on the tools, specifically tools in your home lab for learning network programmability. Rather than the tool being an aside, the tools are the stars of this lab and the others in this learning track.

This lab examines specifically what else do you need to install or add to your home lab, to:

-   Run Python programs in either major version (2 or 3) on Windows, Linux, or Mac.
-   Access some common RESTful APIs, both with API tools and from Python programs.
-   Employ other network programmability tools like Ansible and NETCONF/YANG.

This particular DevNet Learning Lab focuses on Python: how to get it installed for both version 2.7 and 3.x. Let’s take a look at the entire module’s content, with more detail about the topics in this lab.

## Lab Context: DevNet Learning Tracks and Modules

This DevNet Learning Lab was written with a particular DevNet Learning Track and Learning Module in mind. Each individual Learning Lab can be used alone, but it is best used within a track of several labs (a Learning Module), or a larger set of labs made of multiple Learning Modules (a Learning Track). This particular lab is part of a two-module Learning Track, as shown in the next figure, with the first module focusing on APIC-EM in your home lab, and with the second module focusing on desktop tools for network programmability.

This DevNet Learning Lab is the first of five Learning Labs in the second module, and is all about Python. This lab could just tell you to “install Python and get it working”, and leave it to you to figure out the rest of the story. Instead, this lab focuses on the tool – Python – and the related tool to install Python libraries: PIP. The lab provides a guided process through some key related tasks, including:

**Learning Tools**: A review of the DevNet Learning Labs and Sandboxes useful for your early Python-centric learning.

**The Python Interpreter**: Descriptions, links, and exercises to get Python running (and verified as running) on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

**Tips for Running both Versions**: When learning, you may want to use both versions. Running both can be a bit tricky, so this lab works through some of the details, and gives you advice for learning more.

The following figure summarizes the plan for this DevNet Learning Module.
