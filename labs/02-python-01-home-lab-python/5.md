# Installing and Verifying Python 2.7

Now that you know what you have installed, what do you want installed? Do you want a recent 2.x and 3.x Python interpreter? Do you only want to use Python 3.x (that is, some recent version 3 code)? Or only Python 2.7?

As for which specific version to use, as usual with software, there is no one answer. That said, if you have no other reason to choose a particular version, the latest available version of 2.7 and 3.6 makes the most sense.

As for the choice of whether to install both Python 2 and Python 3, versus just one or the other, is up to you. This lab shows how to install one version of 2.7, and one version of 3.x, which should be useful for learning in your home lab. You may decide that you would rather use 2.7 only, or 3.x only, which is fine. Or, you might decide you want multiple versions of 2.7 and 3.x. This lab shows how to install and update one version of Python 2.7 and one of Python 3.x, as a reasonable middle ground.

All that said, note that installing both the older and newer versions of Python, rather than one version only, will require you to think a little more about what happens behind the scenes and to be a little more careful with commands.

## A Brief Word about OS Skills

This lab assumes that you have some basic OS skills on your preferred OS. For instance, you should be able to bring up a command prompt on your computer. At the same time, this lab does not attempt to teach those skills as if you’ve never used the OS before. Hopefully, this lab strikes a good balance.

## Installing Python 2.7 on Windows

The installation process on most Windows OS’s follows a pretty typical Windows application installation process. If you already have a recent Python 2 version installed, as just verified at the end of the previous page, you can move on past this step. If not, assuming you want to install the most recent Python 2.7 release, use these steps:

1.  Navigate to [www.python.org](http://www.python.org)

2.  Click the [Downloads menu item](https://www.python.org/downloads/) at the top of the page

3.  The page should list the most recent 2.7 and 3.x release download at the top of the page, for the OS of the system from which you are web browsing. Click that link, or follow the navigation to list [all the Windows versions of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) for Windows.

4.  Download the executable installer for your system.

5.  Run the installer file on your windows machine to install the Python interpreter.  

6. (Important!) When running the installer app, make sure to add the python executables to your system PATH by:

      1.  Python 2.7: Choose the installation app’s option to customize the installation, and then scroll to find the option to add the executables to the PATH. (By default, the installer would not add the directory containing the Python executables to your system Path).

      2.  Python 3.x: Check the “add to path” checkbox (see sample below) during installation.

Note that on Windows, you should take the extra steps to put the **python** command in your system’s execution path. The Python installer, by default, does not add the directories with the Python commands in them to the PATH variable. You should override that default at installation, adding Python to your PATH. For Python 2.7, you have to first select the option to use custom settings for the installation, and then look for the option to add the commands to the path, as shown on the left side of the figure. The Python 3.6 process puts the checkbox on a screen that is part of each system’s installation process, as shown on the right side of the figure.

## Installing Python 2.7 on Linux

In comparison to Windows, Linux uses a much different process for the installation of many apps. To install an application, you use a [*package manager*](https://www.howtogeek.com/117579/htg-explains-how-software-installation-package-managers-work-on-linux/). The package manager is an app itself, which checks an index of available software packages. To install new software, you run a command that names the software you want to install, for instance, “python” for the Python version 2 interpreter. The package manager searches the index for the location of the software, downloads the files, and installs the software, as shown in the example for Ubuntu Linux in the next figure with the apt package manager.

![alt text](/posts/files/02-python-01-home-lab-python/assets/images/desktop-1-10.png)

The type of Linux system dictates the specific package manager. For instance, Debian-based Linux systems (including Ubuntu) typically use **apt** (Advanced Package Tool) and **apt-get**. Linux systems from the Red Hat family typically often use **yum**. This lab uses examples from Ubuntu, therefore showing the use of apt.

To install Python, or upgrade from an older minor version, use the **apt-get** or **apt** commands (or similar for your system). For instance, as shown in the next example, one Ubuntu system used to test when creating this lab happened to come with Python 2.7.12 installed. The **sudo apt install python** command attempted to install the most recent Python 2.x interpreter, but per apt’s indices, the latest version was already installed, so it took no action.

```
> wendellodom@ubuntu:~$ python -V
> Python 2.7.12
> wendellodom@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install python
> Reading package lists... Done
> Building dependency tree
>python is already the newest version (2.7.11-1).
>0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

Note that Linux package managers may not have the latest Python version in their index, so that you can install a recent - but not most recent - release of Python. The package manager may be more convenient, but the package installer might be a few minor versions behind. For instance, if using the apt package manager, you could compare the specific releases that you could install with both installation options as follows:

-   From any web browser, check the [Python Software Foundation downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to find the most recent release. (You can download the most recent release, or earlier releases as well.)

-   From a command shell, use the **sudo apt show python** command, which lists details about the python package per the apt index. Near the top, you should see a range of specific version/release numbers that apt can install.

## Installing Python 2.7 on Mac

Apple includes Python 2.x with Mac OS X, and if your Mac has a recent OS, Python will likely be at a 2.7 release. (Remember, Python 2.7.0 was first released in the year 2010.) So, you may already have a pretty recent Python version 2.7 interpreter ready to use.

Regardless, you can install the latest Python (to upgrade the existing Python) if you prefer. To do so, you have two options:

-   Similar to Windows: Download an installer file for that option from [python.org](https://www.python.org)

-   Similar to Linux: Use an OS X application package manager, like [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), to find and install the Python interpreter.

The first option follows the same general steps as just listed for a Windows installation. You browse the [python.org site](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), download the installer (a .dmg file for OS X), and run the installer file to walk through the installation process.

The second option uses a package manager. Most end-user Mac application install either from the App store or from a download of an installer file. Some apps use a Mac package manager, with this DevNet Learning Lab showing examples with the popular Mac package manager [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/). To use this option to install Python, you start by installing HomeBrew, and then install Python (**brew install python**).

## Verifying Your Python Installation

Did you update your code while working through the steps on this page? Repeat the commands in these tables for your chosen OS, and make some notes as to what you have installed at this point.
