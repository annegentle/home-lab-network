# Installing and Verifying Python 2.7

Now that you know what you have installed, what do you want installed? as usual with software, there is no one answer. Do you want a recent 2.x and 3.x Python interpreter? Do you only want to use Python 3.x (that is, some recent version 3 code)? Or only Python 2.7?

If you have no specific reason to choose a particular version, use the latest available version of 2.7 and 3.6.

The choice of whether to install both Python 2 and Python 3 or only one version is up to you. This lab shows how to install one version of 2.7, and one version of 3.x for learning in your home lab. You may decide that you would rather use 2.7 only, or 3.x only. You may decide you want multiple versions of 2.7 and 3.x. All are fine choices. This lab shows how to install and update one version of Python 2.7 and one of Python 3.x, as a reasonable middle ground.

Note that installing both the older and newer versions of Python, rather than one version only, requires you to think about what happens behind the scenes and to be careful with commands.

## A Brief Word about OS Skills

This lab assumes that you have some basic operating system (OS) skills on your preferred OS. For example, you should be able to bring up a command prompt on your OS. This lab does not teach those skills as if you’ve never used the OS before. Hopefully, this lab strikes a good balance.

## Installing Python 2.7 on Windows

The Python installation process follows a typical Windows application installation process. If you already have a recent Python 2 version installed and verified, you can skip this step. If not, assuming you want to install the most recent Python 2.7 release, use these steps:

1.  Navigate to [www.python.org](http://www.python.org).

2.  Click the [Downloads menu item](https://www.python.org/downloads/) at the top of the page. The page lists the most recent 2.7 and 3.6 release download links. 

3.  Click the link for the 2.7 version, or go to the list of [all the Windows versions of Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

4.  Download the executable installer for your system.

5.  Run the installer file on your Windows machine to install the Python interpreter.

6. (Important!) When running the installer app, make sure to add the Python executables to your system PATH.

    1.  Python 2.7: Choose the installation app’s option to customize the installation, scroll to find the option to "Add python.exe to Path," and then click to display the disk icon instead of the red X icon.
    2.  Python 3.x: Check the “add to path” checkbox (see sample below) during installation.

On Windows, take the extra steps to put the **python** command in your system’s execution path. The Python installer, by default, does not add the directories with the Python commands in them to the PATH variable. You should override that default at installation, adding Python to your PATH. For Python 2.7, you have to first select the option to use custom settings for the installation, and then look for the option to add the commands to the path, as shown on the left side of the figure. The Python 3.6 process puts the checkbox on a screen that is part of each system’s installation process, as shown on the right side of the figure.

## Installing Python 2.7 on Linux

Linux uses a [*package manager*](https://www.howtogeek.com/117579/htg-explains-how-software-installation-package-managers-work-on-linux/) process for installing many apps. The package manager application checks an index of available software packages. To install new software, you run a command that names the software you want to install, for instance, “python” for the Python version 2 interpreter. The package manager searches the index for the location of the software, downloads the files, and installs the software, as shown in the example for Ubuntu Linux in the next figure with the apt package manager.

The type of Linux system dictates the specific package manager. For instance, Debian-based Linux systems (including Ubuntu) typically use **apt** (Advanced Package Tool) and **apt-get**. Linux systems from the Red Hat family typically often use **yum**. This lab uses examples from Ubuntu, showing the use of apt.

To install Python, or upgrade from an older minor version, use the **apt-get** or **apt** commands (or similar for your system). For instance, as shown in the next example, one Ubuntu system used to test when creating this lab happened to come with Python 2.7.12 installed. The **sudo apt install python** command attempted to install the most recent Python 2.x interpreter, but per apt’s indices, the latest version was already installed, so it took no action.

```
> wendellodom@ubuntu:~$ python -V
> Python 2.7.12
> wendellodom@ubuntu:~$ sudo apt install python
> Reading package lists... Done
> Building dependency tree
>python is already the newest version (2.7.11-1).
>0 upgraded, 0 newly installed, 0 to remove and 0 not upgraded.
```

Note that Linux package managers may not have the latest Python version in their index, but you can install a recent - perhaps not most recent - release of Python. The package manager is convenient but the package installer might be a few minor versions behind. For instance, if using the apt package manager, compare the specific releases that you could install with both installation options as follows:

-   From any web browser, check the [Python Software Foundation downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to find the most recent release. (You can download the most recent release or earlier releases.)

-   From a command shell, use the **sudo apt show python** command, which lists details about the python package per the apt index. Near the top, you should see a range of specific version/release numbers that apt can install.

## Installing Python 2.7 on Mac

Apple includes Python 2.x with Mac OS X, and if your Mac has a recent OS, Python will likely be at a 2.7 release. (Python 2.7.0 was first released in the year 2010.) You may already have a recent Python version 2.7 interpreter ready to use.

Regardless, you can install the latest Python (to upgrade the existing Python) if you prefer. To do so, you have two options:

-   Similar to Windows: Download an installer file for that option from [python.org](https://www.python.org).

-   Similar to Linux: Use an OS X application package manager, like [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/), to find and install the Python interpreter.

The first option follows the same general steps as just listed for a Windows installation. You browse the [python.org site](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/), download the installer (a `.dmg` file for OS X), and run the installer file.

The second option uses a package manager. Most end-user Mac application install either from the App store or from a download of an installer file. Some apps use a Mac package manager such as the popular Mac package manager [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh/). To use this option to install Python, install HomeBrew and then install Python (**brew install python**).

## Verifying Your Python Installation

Did you update your installation while working through the steps? Repeat the commands in these tables for your chosen OS, and make some notes as to what you have installed at this point.
