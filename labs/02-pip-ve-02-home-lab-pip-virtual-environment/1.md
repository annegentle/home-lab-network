# Introduction

## Objective

Completion Time: 30 minutes

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

-   Use PIP to install and import new Python libraries
-   Create and use Python Virtual Environments
-   Describe the execution path and Python library path used by Python, both globally and when using virtual environments

## Prerequisites

To perform this DevNet Learning Lab, you need:

-   One (or more) personal devices (Windows, Mac, or Linux), with access rights to install new software (for instance, you need administrator access for some installation steps).
-   Internet access
-   Python installed and working on your computer: Version 2.7, or Version 3.x, or one release of each if desired.

## Introduction: The roles of PIP and Python Virtual Environments

This lab focuses on two big topics: PIP and Python Virtual Environments, both of which play an important role in how to best use Python on your computer.

## Lab Context: DevNet Learning Tracks and Modules

As usual, this DevNet Learning Lab is intended to be used within the context of a DevNet Learning Module (which is a set of labs) and a DevNet Learning Track (which is a set of modules). This lab sits in the 2<sup>nd</sup> position in a Learning Module as shown in the following figure, with that entire module about getting network programmability working in your home lab, focusing on tools on your computer OS.

This DevNet Learning Lab asks you to do several exercises on your computer, so that when finished, you will have installed and used PIP, as well as installing and using Python virtual environments. To do that, this lab expects you to have Python already installed. If you happened to install one release each of Python 2.7 and 3.x, per the first lab in Module 2 (as shown in the figure above), then you should be in great shape to follow the steps. However, you should be able to do the steps even with only Python 2.7 or only Python 3.x installed.
