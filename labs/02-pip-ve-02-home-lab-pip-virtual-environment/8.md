# Exercise: Using the Virtual Environment

So far, you have used one command to make a directory in which to store all your virtual environments, and one more command to create a virtual environment. So, while the previous page took a few minutes to read and understand, command-wise, it was not a lot of work. Now that you have created the virtual environment, this next page shows the basics of how to use it – another process with a few facts to learn, but with only one or two more commands.

## Using the Python Virtual Environment

One way to use a Python virtual environment is to activate it inside a command shell. Once activated:

-   Python programs run with the Python installed in the virtual environment
-   Python **import** statements search folders in the virtual environment
-   PIP commands install, update, etc. the packages in the virtual environment

The general idea is straightforward: activate the environment, so that Python actions use the files in the virtual environment. For instance, once activated, the **python** (Linux/Mac) and **py** (Windows) commands should execute the Python interpreter installed in the virtual environment, not from the global environment.

These next exercise steps compare and contrast what happens when you start the Python interpreter, both before activating the virtual environment, and afterwards. You will see that before activation, the OS would run the Python in the global environment, but afterwards, it would run the Python from a subdirectory inside the virtual environment.

1.  Open a command prompt (or use the existing one).
2.  Change directories to move to the directory of the virtual environment. (Note: in everyday use, you do not have to change directories to use the virtual environment; these labs steps just start in that directory to make the lab step wording work.) For instance, if you used all the directory names as shown in this lab, open a new command shell, and begin in a home directory like /users/wendellodom, and then use the **cd labenvs/devnet01** command or similar.
3.  Activate the virtual environment by executing the “activate” script in the virtual environment’s directory, using the appropriate command from the following table. Note the commands assume you are in the directory of the virtual environment, as they list the relative location of the activation scripts.

1.  The activate script also changes the command prompt. Look to the beginning of the prompt in your command shell; it should list the name of the virtual environment (devnet01 in the examples in this lab).
2.  Find the directory from which your OS would run the Python 2.7 interpreter using the **which python** (Linux/Mac) and **where python** (Windows) commands. The first directory listed should be a subdirectory of the virtual environment.

At this point, you have activated the virtual environment. Because you created the virtual environment with Python 2.7, any Python 2.7 programs you run in this command shell will use the virtual environment’s Python and libraries. The next and final exercise with virtual environments examines the libraries.

## Compare Python Library Paths

To show how a virtual environment uses a different set of optional libraries compared to the global environment, the next few exercise steps walk through some **pip** commands in both the global and virtual environments, followed by running a short Python program that displays the Python Library Path.

First, to examine PIP’s installed libraries, check to make sure you have two command shell windows ready to use, as follows:

1.  Move the existing command shell that is running the virtual environment over to the right side of your screen.

2.  Open a new command shell, and place it on the left.

At this point, the command shell on the left should be using the global environment, while the command shell on the right is using the virtual environment. You should also see that extra text to begin the command prompt in the virtual environment shell.

The next steps compare the modules installed with PIP, and guides you through installing the requests module into the virtual environment. At the end of the process, you should have a different version of the requests module in your virtual environment as compared to the global environment, making the point that you could use a virtual environment to use different code versions for different libraries.

1.  List the modules installed by PIP, in each environment, using the **python -m pip list --format=columns** command in both windows. (If following the steps throughout this lab, the virtual environment should list only a few modules, with more modules in the global environment.)

2.  List details about the *requests* module using the **python -m pip show requests** command in both windows. (As a reminder, the *requests* module provides REST services so your program can more easily make REST API calls.) Again, if you followed all the steps in this lab, the virtual environment window should list nothing, because the requests module is not yet installed. The global environment window should list the version of the installed requests module, assuming you followed the earlier steps in this lab.

3.  In the virtual environment, use **pip** to install the requests module, but at a different version than the version you see in the global environment, just to make that point that you can use different library versions. To do that, use either the **python -m pip install requests==2.17** command, or the same command with version 2.18, or with some other version as compared to the version you see listed in the global environment command shell.

4.  Repeat the **python -m pip show requests** command in both windows (global and virtual environments). Note that the virtual environment (on the right side) now has that specific version of the requests module installed, and the global environment’s request module (on the left) has the same version of code it had before.

To complete the proof that the virtual environment uses a different set of modules (as installed by PIP), use the short program listed below. The program displays the Python Library Path used in each environment. Using the same two shells, with global on the left, virtual environment on the right, do these steps:

1.  Ensure that the pair of command shell/prompt windows are arranged as earlier, with the global environment on the left, and the virtual environment on the right. The right-side window’s command prompt should begin with “(devnet01)” or your chosen subdirectory for the virtual environment.

2.  Start a new interactive Python session in both windows (**python** on Linux/Mac, **py -2** on Windows).

3.  Copy/paste the program shown below into each of the interactive Python sessions. The program displays the Python Library Path used by each. Note that many of the virtual environment’s library path directories are subdirectories from the virtual environment.
```
print("Python Path per sys module:")
import sys
for path in sys.path:
print(path)
```

(Note: You may need to press enter a time or two after pasting the program before the final few lines will be interpreted.)
