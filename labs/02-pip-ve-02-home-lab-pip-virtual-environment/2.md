# Understanding Python Modules

When writing code today, much can be done with existing features and modules rather than writing new code. To that end, the Python interpreter installation package includes a number of these modules, but you can download and use more modules in your Python program. This page examines the topic of Python modules, how to import them in your program, and how to make them available to your program.

## The Python Standard Library

When you install the Python interpreter, the software process adds the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) to your computer. The word *Library* refers to a collection of code and features implemented in a variety of files. Basically, the Python Standard Library defines some standard features you have available in Python, some of which happen to be implemented in Python programs themselves, *without needing to download anything else to your computer*.

You can think about the Python Standard Library providing two major branches: built-in features and optional modules. First, the mechanism for using built-in features seems obvious by their name, and you do not need to do anything special to use them. For instance, the **print()** function is a built-in function of the Python Standard Library; you can just add it to your program and use it.

The Python Standard Library also includes many optional modules. However, unlike the built-in features, you must indicate to the interpreter that you want these optional modules available to your program. Your program must use the **import** statement, for example, **import sys**, where the **sys** module is an optional module in the Python Standard Library.

## Exercise: Comparing Built-in and Optional Modules

To see the differences between built-in functions and optional modules, take a moment to search through the [Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) for two functions: **print** and **pprint**. Or just click directly to each with these links:

[print()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) – Built-in Function
[pprint()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pprint.html) – Optional Module

Comparing these two, **print()** acts as the most common standard method to print text to the screen, and does not require an **import print** statement. Pretty Print (pprint), as an optional module, should already be installed on your system, but requires an **import pprint** (or similar) statement before a program can use it. This next exercise shows the difference.

To begin, we need something to print that also shows the benefit of using **pprint** instead of **print**. To do so:

1.  Open a command prompt/shell.
2.  Start a Python 2.7 or 3.x interactive session.
3.  Copy and paste the dictionary in the code sample below to create a dictionary variable to work with.
4.  Type **netdict** (the name of the variable that was just set), which tells the interpreter to display the contents of the variable.

#### Assigning Values to a Dictionary
```
netdict = {
"softwareVersion": "15.2(2.5.72)E4",
"locationName": "Home",
"role": "DISTRIBUTION",
"upTime": "16:11:38.75",
"hostname": "AHEC-2960C1",
"macAddress": "54:78:1a:8e:28:c0",
"series": "Cisco Catalyst 2960-C Series Switches",
"lastUpdated": "2017-08-16 14:13:36",
"bootDateTime": "2016-11-18 07:54:31",
"interfaceCount": "11",
"lineCardCount": "1",
"managementIpAddress": "165.10.1.39",
"platformId": "WS-C2960C-8PC-L",
}
```
The next sequence shows the following logic regarding built-in functions and optional modules. Type in each statement one at a time; you can omit the comment portion at the end of each line.

#### Differences when Using Built-in Versus Optional Modules
```
print(netdict)         # prints value of variable; built-in
pprint.pprint(netdict) # fails; requires import
import pprint          # importing…
pprint.pprint(netdict) # Works because it’s been imported
```
You should have seen these results:

1.  The **print(netdict)** statement should work, because the **print** statement is built-in.
2.  The **pprint.pprint(netdict)** statement should fail, because **pprint**, an optional module, has not been imported.
3.  The **import pprint** statement should work, and import the **pprint** module.
4.  The **pprint.pprint(netdict)** statement should now work. (Note the better formatting of the output as well, which is the main reason to use **pprint**.)

## Extra Exercise

Go to the [Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) doc page, and look at the modules listed there. Try to import some of them by name. For instance, search for the **sys** module imported with the **import sys** command earlier in this DevNet Learning Lab.
