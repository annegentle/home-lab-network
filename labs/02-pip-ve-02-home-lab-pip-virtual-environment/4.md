# Basic PIP Verification

Now that you know some of the important context about how Python works as an application on your computer, this next page in the lab walks through some steps of how to use PIP and verify your current Python libraries.

First, as for the PIP code, the Python installation process installs PIP, so for this next page focuses on verifying your PIP installation. If for some reason PIP is not installed, or does not work, you can re-install it to make it available on your system, as discussed at the bottom of this page.

First, for a quick verification, just open a command shell and issue a **pip** command list **pip list** (which lists the installed packages) or **pip -V** (which lists the PIP version). If those commands work, you know that PIP is installed and working for the Python version shown in the **pip –V** command output. If you have chosen to use either Python 2.7 or 3.x, and not both, then the PIP instance you just verified should be working with that one installed version.

(Note: On Linux/Mac, the first **pip** command within a command shell that causes a change may need to be prefaced with **sudo**, so that the system will prompt you for the systems administrator password to authorize the use of the command.)

If you installed both Python 2.7 and 3.x, then you need to do some more verification, because so far, you will have verified PIP for one version or the other. PIP works independently for each version of Python, so you need to know how to use some variations on the **pip** command to make it work with both versions of Python installed on your computer.

## PIP with Python 2.7 and 3.x on Your Computer

PIP installs packages into the site-packages directory, which is part of Python’s Library Path. However, Python keeps separate Python Library Path, including a separate Site Packages directory, for each version. As a result, PIP acts independently for Python 2.7 and Python 3.x.

When you execute the **pip** command, you are executing the **pip** command that operates against one or the other version of Python, but not both. So, take a moment and look at your command prompt/shell, and issue the **pip -V** command again to display the PIP version, along with the Python version it operates with. What Python version is your **pip** command managing? Whichever it is, you will need some other command to use PIP to manage packages for the other version.

#### Calling PIP as a Python Program

One way to call PIP to work with one Python version or another is to first call a specific version of the Python interpreter. PIP is written in Python. So, if you call the Python 2.7 interpreter, and tell it to run pip, you will run the pip that updates Python 2.7. Similarly, if you call the Python 3.x interpreter, and tell it to run pip, you will run the pip that updates Python 3.6. Simple enough.

The next figure lists the commands, and summarizes the main concepts. For instance, **python –m pip list** calls the Python 2.x interpreter, which will then run the **pip** command for Python 2.x (because the **python** command on Linux/Mac calls the Python 2.7 interpreter). The **python3 -m pip list** command on Linux/Mac calls the Python 3.x interpreter, resulting in the execution of the **pip** command for Python 3.x.

#### Using the pip2 and pip3 Commands

Another option to call the correct PIP command is to use the **pip2** and **pip3** commands. The Python 2 version of PIP includes a pip2 command, with the similar **pip3** command included with Python 3.x installations. You can just use the **pip2** and **pip3** commands instead of **pip**. For example, **pip2 list** to list installed packages for Python 2.7.

## Managing Python Modules with PIP: Reference

Over time, you will likely install, list, and uninstall different Python packages with PIP. The commands are relatively straightforward, with clear syntax, and with good help available with the **pip help** command. The following table lists a good mix of commands that should cover most of what your normal needs with PIP.

(Note: From here forward, all the **pip** commands will begin with “pip”. It is up to you to choose which method to use to call pip for the correct version of Python as described earlier on this page.)

## PIP Installation

The top of this page of the lab began by telling you that if you have Python, you should have PIP. What if none of the **pip** commands worked? No problem. You can install PIP directly on your system.

First, you should start with [the PIP documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) to read about the manual methods to install PIP. The process asks you to download an installation Python script and run it. And if you chose to run both version s of Python: Note that in the cases in which the installation documents ask you to run a Python script as part of the installation, you will need to run it twice: once with Python 2.7, and once with Python 3.6, installing PIP for each.
