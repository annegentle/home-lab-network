# Exercise: Create a Virtual Environment

For this exercise, you will create a virtual environment and use it for the sake of demonstrating how the virtual environment differs from the global environment. Then you can create others, and use them as much as you like. This page shows the process up through creating the virtual environment, while the next page shows how to activate and use the virtual environment.

To keep the lab process straightforward, the steps on this page ask you to create a Python 2.7 virtual environment, using the same code version you already have installed, whatever it is. (If you chose to use only Python 3.x on your lab computer, you can do this same exercise, just using Python 3.x instead.) Then, once created, you will use PIP within the virtual environment, installing a non-default version of some a Python package, just to show how the process of using different package code versions works within a virtual environment.

As another way to keep these lab steps straightforward, this page uses one of several virtual environment tools. Several tools exist that create Python virtual environments; this DevNet Learning Lab uses the long-established virtualenv tool.

The sections in this page’s exercise follow this flow:

1.  Install/upgrade the **virtualenv** tool.
2.  Create a folder to keep all your virtual environments organized and easily located.
3.  Create the virtual environment using the **virtualenv** tool.

## Install/Upgrade the virtualenv Tool

Install the virtualenv tool so that you can create your first virtual environment. The virtualenv tool can be installed and upgraded using PIP, and should be installed into the global environment. You can install it into the global environment for either Python 2.7 or 3.6, but this lab shows the installation into Python 2.7.

Follow these steps to install or upgrade virtualenv. As a reminder on Linux/Mac, note that you may need to preface some commands with **sudo** to prove that you have the correct authorization, so if the command fails, repeat it, but with **sudo** added to the beginning of the command.

1.  Open a command prompt/shell.
2.  Issue the command **python -m pip install virtualenv** (Linux/Mac) or **py -2 -m pip install virtualenv** (Windows).
3.  If the previous command shows that virtualenv is already installed, consider updating the code by repeating the same command, but adding the **-U** parameter to the end of the command.
4.  Display details about the version of virtualenv tool using the command **python -m pip show virtualenv** command (Linux/Mac) or **py -2 -m pip show virtualenv** (Windows).
5.  Do not close your command prompt/shell – you will use it in the next steps as well.

## Create a Folder to Hold Your Virtual Environment

Each virtual environment is contained with its own folder or subdirectory. For the next step, all you should do is create the folder. However, it helps to think about where you might place your various virtual environment folders, just to keep yourself organized, so this section starts with some recommendations, followed by the lab exercise steps.

#### Keep All Virtual Environments in the Same Directory

One strategy people use is to create one directory as the one place they collect their virtual environment. That makes it easier to find them when you have been away from your network programmability tasks for a while.

So, as a recommendation, consider adding one subdirectory off your home directory and keep your virtual environment directories there. The home directory is the default directory for a user in a command prompt/shell, usually something like /users/username (where “username” is the username of the user). Then make up a name for a subdirectory, like the /labenvs subdirectory shown in the figure. You will probably want a name that is memorable, but also not too long.

#### Keep One Like-Named Virtual Environment Subdirectory for Each Project

The other common strategy begins with the idea that you might keep your programs and related files for each project separated from each other. Then, each project that uses a virtual environment places the virtual environment subdirectory in the project folder, with the same subdirectory name. For instance, if you have created 10 directories for various Python projects, each could have a subdirectory named “venv” or something else that makes you think of a virtual environment. Then whenever you are working on any project, you could know to look for that subdirectory.

#### Exercise: Create a Directory for All Virtual Environments

If you like the idea of putting all your virtual environments into the same directory, you need to choose where to create that directory, and create it. The steps are simple: choose a new directory where you can keep your virtual environments, and create the directory. This next exercise asks you to create a subdirectory off your home directory named /labenvs, using these steps:

1.  Use a command shell/prompt.
2.  Move to your home directory using these commands: Windows (the **cd %HOMEPATH%** command), Linux/Mac (the **cd ~** command).
3.  Confirm the value of your home directory using these commands: Windows (the **cd** command), Linux/Mac (the **pwd** command).
4.  Create (make) the new directory, for instance, for a subdirectory named “labenvs”: **mkdir labenvs**.
5.  Confirm the directory exists, and move to that directory as the current directory:
    - Issue a **cd labenvs** command (Linux/Mac/Windows)
    - Display the current directory (**pwd** on Linux/Mac; **cd** on Windows)

## Create a Python Virtual Environment

Python virtual environments need to be created once, and then you use it over and over. Creating the virtual environment adds a directory and copies some files. For example, the **virtualenv** tool performs a Python interpreter installation into the virtual environment directory. Then you can repeatedly activate, use, and deactivate the virtual environment, as shown in the figure.

Let’s create a virtual environment with the **virtualenv** tool!

1.  At the end of the previous steps, you should have a command prompt open, with the current directory being the directory you created for storing all your virtual environments. If not, back up to the previous section and repeat those steps. For instance, a **pwd** command (Linux/Mac) should list something like: /users/wendellodom/labenvs.
2.  Choose a new directory name for your new virtual environment, but do not make this directory. (The upcoming steps will both make the directory and create the virtual environment.)
3.  To convince yourself that the new directory name does not exist, list the subdirectories of your current directory with the **ls –l** command (Linux, Mac) or **dir** (Windows).
4.  Create the virtual environment. Use “devnet01” as the directory name if you want to match the names used in this Learning Lab. You can choose one of these options based on your operating system:
    - (Linux/Mac) Use the **virtualenv** *directory* **--python=python2.7** command.
    - (Windows) Use the **virtualenv** *directory* **--python=c:\\python27\\python.exe** command.
    - (Linux/Mac) Use the **python2 -m virtualenv** *directory* command.
    - (Windows) Use the **py -2 -m virtualenv** *directory* command.

The different options show a few ways to tell the **virtualenv** command which version of Python to install into the virtual environment. The first two options reference the specific Python version to install, while the other two options install the same Python version used by the **python2** or **py** command, respectively. Here’s a sample of the types of messages you might see after using the first option.
```
Running virtualenv with interpreter /usr/bin/python2.7
New python executable in /Users/WO15/labenvs/devnet01/bin/python
Installing setuptools, pip, wheel...done.
```
Take a brief look inside the new virtual environment directory by:

  1.  Use the **cd** *dirname* command to move to the virtual environment’s directory as the current directory, for example, **cd devnet01**.
  2.  List the files inside that directory: **ls -l** (Linux, Mac) or **dir** (Windows). You should see several subdirectories.
