# PIP Concepts

For many Python tasks, you may not find a useful built-in or optional module to do the work you want to accomplish. In those cases, you may learn about some other Python modules that you can easily download and use on your computer. In fact, many Python programs take advantage of other Python modules not found in the Python Standard Library.

To make the process of using other Python modules much easier, the Python Software Foundation gives us a couple of important tools. First, they create a repository of information about available software packages (that is, groups of Python modules available for download). That repository, called the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) (PyPI), allows a programmer to add their code to PyPI, enabling anyone else to discover the package, download it, and use it.

PIP is software, installed on your computer, that lets you install and manage optional Python packages. PIP is a Python package manager, much like Linux uses application package managers like apt and yum. However, instead of managing the installation of applications, PIP manages the installation of Python modules (files), as grouped together into what PIP calls a *package* (a group of related Python files). In fact, PIP, depending on the source, stands for either:

-   PIP Installs Packages
-   PIP Installs Python

PIP uses some straightforward commands and processes. PIP installs, updates, removes, and lists Python packages (sets of Python modules) into your computer. To do so, you type a command (**pip**), identifying the name of the package. PIP checks the PyPI index, finds the package, and installs Python code into your computer.

For example, you will likely use the **requests** Python package when making REST API calls from your Python program. The Python requests module provides a convenient method to make REST calls (**get**, **put**, etc.). The requests module is not included in the Python Standard Library, but it is installable with PIP. So, a quick **pip install requests** command from a command prompt could install the requests module, making it ready for the **import requests** statement in your Python code. (We will do exactly that in an exercise later in this lab.)

## Python Library Path

The whole point of using PIP to install a Python package is so your Python program can use some function in some module that is part of that package. So, once installed with PIP, you will need to import the correct module(s). To complete the story, think from a moment about the **import** command: where should it look to find that new module that you just downloaded and installed with PIP?

The Python interpreter uses the concept of a Python Path (or Python Library Path) to keeps track of all the directories where Python installs Python modules that can be later imported into a Python program. So, when the interpreter itself is installed, it places all the importable optional Python modules into directories, and adds those directories to the Python Path. Similarly, to be ready to use those modules that PIP installs, the interpreter includes the folders used by PIP in its Python Path.
