# Python Virtual Environments

At this point, the lab shifts focus to a Python feature called Python Virtual Environments. While the benefits of using PIP are obvious from your early days using Python, the need and benefit for using virtual environments will be less obvious at first. This page works through a few of the reasons to think about using virtual environments, with the next page working through an exercise that shows just how easy it is to set up and use them.

## The Global Python Execution Path and Library Path

For the sake of discussion, think about Python 2.7 as installed on your computer that you use for your home lab, ignoring Python 3.x for now. The installation process installs the Python 2.7 interpreter, some other tools, and the Python Standard Library. You can then use PIP to install other optional Libraries, making them part of the Python Library Path. Once installed, all Python programs that use Python 2.7 will use that interpreter and use the libraries found in the Python Library Path, as shown in the figure.

The idea of the Python that you use, and the associated libraries, is called the Python global environment. That is, if you use commands like python, python2, and py -2 on your computer (depending on the OS), you will start Python version 2, and it will use some set of install libraries.

Having one and only one Python global environment on your computer has some shortcomings. For instance, what if one Python program had problems when using a specific release of Python 2.7, while the others did not, so you wanted to use both releases of Python 2.7 â€“ one for one program, and the other version for the rest? Also, all the libraries installed by PIP have independent software versioning processes. Some of your programs might need to use different versions of the same Library. The global environment scheme shown in the figure does not allow for any of these options.

## Python Virtual Environments

The Python Virtual Environment feature solves this kind of code/library version and dependency issue, as well as some other issues as well. Instead of one single global environment, you can create multiple virtual environments. Simply put, a virtual environment includes:

-   A separate installation of the Python interpreter and related tools, at the version/release you choose.
-   A separate Python Library Path, including a completely different site-packages directory (where PIP installs libraries).
-   PIP operates independently with each virtual environment, so that a library installed by PIP in one virtual environment does not affect the other virtual environments nor the global environment.

For instance, imagine you still had those four Python programs from the previous figure, but you wanted some difference in Python interpreter version or library code version for both program 3 and 4. You could create a separate virtual environment for each, as shown in the next figure.

## When to Use Virtual Environments

You may not feel the need to use virtual environments early in your time of learning about network programmability. However, there are many good reasons to use them from your early days of learning about network programmability, and once you understand them, they are easy to use. Also, you will see virtual environments used in Cisco presentations, DevNet, and Cisco dCloud, so it will be useful to understand the basics of virtual environments. To that end, the next page walks through the creation and use of a virtual environment.
