# APIC-EM on a Generic Rack Server Hardware – Example 2
While the APIC-EM install docs list that minimum processor speed of 2.4 GHz, the clock speed of the processor is just one factor that determines the amount of work a processor can perform. You personally could spend time researching CPU benchmarks to try and find the very fastest CPU. But you also want to get on with the work of installing APIC-EM in your lab, so there is a probably a happy medium between the two. This next topic gives a little insight into the topic without taking us too far down that path.

## Comparing Processors
Given that clock speed is just one factor impacting CPU performance, the first APIC-EM requirement that you might choose to relax might be that processor speed. Rather than drag through a long discussion of benchmarks, take this example.

Intel releases versions of their processors over time, with the later versions being improved in some ways. Sometimes, the better/later version processor has a slower base CPU clock rate. As a specific example of that, here are two processors you might come across when configuring rack mount servers are:

- [Xeon E5-2620-v3](https://ark.intel.com/products/83352/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2620-v3-15M-Cache-2_40-GHz): 2.4 GHz base clock, 8 CPU cores, two threads/core.
- [Xeon E5-2620-v4](https://ark.intel.com/products/92986/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2620-v4-20M-Cache-2_10-GHz): 2.1 GHz base clock, 8 CPU cores, two threads/core.

As you might expect, the v4 processor has a better performance benchmark than the earlier v3 processor of the same series – but without the 2.4 GHz base clock rate. If you open web pages for the links for each processor, you will see a page like the one shown in the next image. Then look for the “benchmarks” item, and you can see Intel’s performance data on each processor.

If you want to do a little research on the processors, this link is a great place to look to [compare Intel processors](https://ark.intel.com/Search/FeatureFilter?productType=processors). For servers that would be in the range of what you’d use for APIC-EM, or for a more general network programmability server platform, when searching, consider filtering your search for the 6-12 core range, and probably ignore processors that didn’t support virtualization (aka that did not support multiple threads per CPU).

Of course, using a server that has less CPU per the stated APIC-EM requirements is a risk, so consider that when choosing where to spend your money on a server.

## Disk Capacity, Disk Speed, and RAM
While you might consider a compromise on the processor, for the reasons just given, it appears that the disk capacity, disk speed, and RAM numbers quoted for APIC-EM should not be relaxed. That is, meet those standards, or use more/better.

For disk, meeting the need to 200 GB and 200 MBs transfer rate should not be a problem, and not cost a lot. For hard disk drives (HDDs), the cost difference between disks of approximately 250 GB, 500GB, and 1 TB are in the tens of dollars. You can easily find HDDs that support SATA III (rated at 600 MBs transfer rate) with good price performance. And most any Solid State Drives (SSDs), along with the bus technology it uses, far surpass the 200MBs requirement. In fact, you might be better off spending on a fast SSD or two for this server.

For RAM, again, stick with 32G as your minimum.

## Example White-Box Configuration 2: Slower Base Clock Rate
This second example configuration on the page takes those same requirements from the previous white-box rack-mount server, and removes the clock speed requirement. This example priced out at about $1700 US: $250 less than the previous example. The pricing was run during the same day as the previous pricing exercise, and did not include taxes or shipping. The following table lists the APIC-EM requirements again, with the specifications for the priced system:

The following table summarizes the APIC-EM requirements again, and puts the two custom rack-mount servers side-by-side for easier comparison. Note that both examples used the same RAM and Disk parts, with the only difference being the processor used.

| Requirement | Value/ Amount per 1.4.1x Installation Docs | Custom Rack Server 1 | Custom Rack Server 1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CPU Cores | 6 (Recommended 12) | 6 ([Intel Xeon E5-1650v4](https://ark.intel.com/products/92994/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-1650-v4-15M-Cache-3_60-GHz)) | 8 ([Intel Xeon E5-2620v4](https://ark.intel.com/products/92986/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2620-v4-20M-Cache-2_10-GHz)) |
| CPU Speed | 2.4GHz | 3.4 GHz | 2.1 GHz |

| Price (May 2017) | - | $1950 | $1700|

## Options to Consider
Again, there are many variations to spend or save a little money – here are a few variations that were interesting:

- **Save $150, Meet Processor Requirements:** We could have gotten the price down about $150 by choosing an Intel Xeon E5-2609-v4 processor. However, that processor does not support threads, and its performance benchmarks were about half of the Intel E5-2620v4 shown for this latest example. But it did meet the literal requirements (including clock rate) for running APIC-EM.
- **Add $320, Get 10 Cores/20 Threads:** Bumping up to 10 cores/20 threads was not a lot more money at $320, with an [Intel E5-2630-v4 processor](http://ark.intel.com/products/92981/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2630-v4-25M-Cache-2_20-GHz).
- **Add $950, Get 12 Cores/24 Threads:** However, to get to 12 cores, the cheapest option added almost $1000 more to the cost. So, getting to a 10 core/20 thread server for a general-purpose programmability platform may be a good sweet spot today.


## Exercise: Build Sample Configurations for Yourself
If you are enjoying these comparisons, take time right now to begin your own research with a baseline rackmount system of your own. In your notes, build a table like the one below. Think about your own plan, following this kind of planning tasks:

- Look to the [APIC-EM installation documentation](http://demand.cisco.com/APIC-EM_VM?elqTrackId=c4e8000f357c4ec2a841c7a581a3f377&elq=00000000000000000000000000000000&elqaid=5108&elqat=2&elqCampaignId=) to discover the current APIC-EM version and the current hardware requirements for a bare-metal installation.
- Make your own notes about these specifications in a place where you can find them again (e.g., OneNote, Evernote, etc.)
- Search the Internet for “custom rack mount server” or similar, and browse at some of the sites until you find one that is easy to use to configure and price a server. (You can comparison shop later; for now, just find one that is easy to use.)
- Try to build a minimum system (that is, no extras) for the current APIC-EM hardware specifications, to see if your price was better or worse than what this lab’s experiment found.
- If you are thinking of buying a general-purpose server for all your network programmability learning, repeat the exercise, bumping up your CPU, RAM, etc. in your plan.
