# Summary

Most networkers that build their own home lab will likely add a server to their lab over time. This lab has shown some options based on a minimum set of requirements for APIC-EM. As you work through your own thinking and planning for a home lab server, remember to look at the options discussed here, and find a server that gives you the right amount of performance, growth, and flexibility for your home lab:

- Rack mount servers
- Desktops
- Mini desktops

For APIC-EM specifically, you should begin any search for a server by looking for the bare-metal hardware requirements for whatever version of APIC-EM is the latest version. From there, you can consider which options you might relax for your needs in a non-production lab, for instance, not bothering with the RAID requirement. Hopefully you can find a system that meets your needs, with the low price offered by some high-end desktops, or the expandability and power of some basic rack-mount servers.
