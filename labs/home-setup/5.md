# APIC-EM on a Generic Rack Server Hardware – Example 1
This page makes a pair of useful comparisons to the supported UCS hardware by looking at options with custom white-box rack mount servers. Using a rack mount server has some advantages in home lab, particularly if you already put most of your networking and other lab devices into a rack. A single rack unit (1U) server can have plenty of power as your APIC-EM server. And while Cisco UCS servers are hugely popular in enterprise data centers, using a white-box server in your home lab, to save a few dollars, can make good sense. The rest of this page of the Learning Lab looks at some options.

## Repeating the APIC-EM Requirements
To begin the comparisons, this page starts again with the same APIC-EM hardware requirements discussed for UCS servers. The only requirement removed for this first white-box configuration comparison is that the server itself no longer has to be a UCS server. The figure repeats the key requirements:

The process to find the examples for this page was straightforward. We just searched the Internet for phrases like:

- Custom rack server
- Generic rack server

Then we looked for sites that made it easy to configure servers and compare different options, and used sites that showed the prices as well. (Note that you could also use any brand-name vendor’s web site as well, as they often sell rack-mount servers.)

## Example White-Box Configuration 1: Meets Requirements
This first example configuration attempts to meet APIC-EM requirements, but just barely meet the requirements to save the most money as possible. This first example priced out at $1950 US; the pricing was run in May 2017, and did not include taxes or shipping. The following table lists the APIC-EM requirements again, with the specifications for the priced system:

Beyond the details in the figure, here are a few other comments about this example system:

- **6 Cores, 12 Threads:** The CPU chosen for this system does support virtualization so that you could have 12 virtual CPUs when using a hypervisor.
- **No RAID:** It does not support RAID at all as configured (the earlier UCS example does support RAID.) RAID is the one literal APIC-EM hardware requirement ignored for this system, beyond the obvious fact that the server is not a Cisco UCS server.
- **Two Ethernet:** While APIC-EM requires one LAN adapter, for home use, you will often want two. Many rack mount servers supported two built-in 10/100/1000 Ethernet ports without additional cost.


## Options to Consider

Of course, for every example, there are many variations to spend or save a little money. Also, you should be thinking about how much you might expand your requirements beyond what Cisco asks for an APIC-EM system if you want to have a server to use for many purposes in your home lab. For instance, buying a CPU with 10 cores that supports virtualization for 20 threads, and buying 64 or 128G of RAM, may be worth the money in your case.

That said, in this example, here are a few examples of variations, just as food for thought:

- **Save $250, more cores:** Using the 8 core E5-2620v4 Processor would have saved $250, and given you 8 cores/16 threads, but at 2.1GHz base clock speed, it didn’t meet the literal requirements.
- **Add $30, more disk:** Upgrading to a 1TB disk would have cost only $30.
- **Add $250, 4 More Ethernet:** Adding 4 x 1 Gigabit Ethernet interfaces (in 1 PCIe expansion card) would have cost about $250.
