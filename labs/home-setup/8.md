# Factory-Built and Build-Your-Own Desktops
While the Intel NUC computers fill a market niche, it turns out that some high-end Desktops have enough power to meet the requirements for running APIC-EM – sometimes even without compromising on any of the processor requirements. This final section of this DevNet Learning Lab examines two options for Desktops: Upgrading a factory-built desktop computer, and building your own desktop computer.

## High-End Factory-Built Desktops w/ 32G RAM Support
Not long ago, desktop computers tended to have a maximum RAM of 16G. That limit was a function of both the processor and the motherboard. More and more today, higher-end desktop systems use processors and motherboards that will now support 32G of RAM, even though they seldom ship to the retail store with 32G of RAM installed.

The fact that some desktops today come with processors with 4 cores/8 threads, and the capability to support 32G of RAM, means that you might save a few more dollars to run APIC-EM by just buying a desktop computer. For instance, just search online or at the local computer superstore for systems with 4 cores and support for 32G RAM. These systems will most likely also have:

- Disk Capacity: Often will have Enough disk capacity
- Disk Speed: Probably at least SATA3 (600 MBs) disk speed
- RAM installed: Probably not 32G RAM

With a bit of searching, you might find a desktop on sale, which after upgrading the RAM, looks very close to the specifications in the Intel NUC Skull Canyon build seen on the previous page. At that point, you just install APIC-EM on the disk, overwriting whatever OS was already installed.

Note that in our pricing exercise for this Learning Lab, we priced a few at around $800 after paying for the necessary upgrades. 

## Build Your Own System
If you have a tight budget, what is the very lowest priced option you can find, without sacrificing any of the APIC-EM requirements? You may get the best price by building your own system from parts. These last few examples show that, with systems that meet all APIC-EM requirements (except for RAID support). And these are the cheapest of all the examples shown in this Learning Lab.

First, you have to build your own system (BYOS). Doing so is not difficult today. However, compared to buying a factory-built system, you will probably spend more time researching and more time troubleshooting while building the computer. But the process is not difficult.

The first build-your-own example uses an [AMD Ryzen 5 1600](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-1600).  The facts that make this processor an interesting include:

- 6 Cores (12 threads)
- Good price
- 3.2 GHz base clock speed (meets APIC-EM literal requirement)

To build the system, you must buy the main components and build it. The major purchases include:

- Chassis
- Motherboard
- CPU (as mentioned already)
- Disk drive(s)
- RAM
- Expansion cards if needed

For the shopping list built for this Learning Lab, after adding all those parts, the system had the specifications shown in the next figure.

For comparison, we built a shopping list for a similar system, but with a motherboard that worked with an [Intel I7-6800K](https://ark.intel.com/products/94188/Intel-Core-i7-6850K-Processor-15M-Cache-up-to-3_80-GHz).  The processor has a base clock rate of 3.6 GHz, 6 cores, and 12 threads. The shopping list used the same RAM and disk as the AMD build-your-own example. The table below lists the parts and prices, with the total, for easier comparison.

| Component	 | Example 1: AMD Ryzen 5 1600	 | Example 2: Intel I7-6800K |
|---|---|---|
| Chassis (Tower) | $40 | 	$40 |
| Motherboard | $195 | $195 |
| 2 x 10/100/1000 | (On Motherboard) | (On Motherboard) |
| Processor  | $200 | $330 |
| Disk (Samsung 250G NVMe SSD) | $130 | $130 |
| RAM (Crucial 32G RAM) | $240 | $240 |
| Total | $705 | $835 |

As you can see from these examples, if you have the confidence and ability to build your own server, then you may be able to create your own server and save yet a little more.

## Exercise: Desktop and/or BYOS
You know the drill by now. If either of this options sound appealing, take the time to do a little research at your leisure – for desktops and/or a build-your-own-system.

| Requirement | Value/Amount per 1.4.1x Installation Docs | Requirements: Desktop | Requirements: BYOS |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU Cores | 6 (Recommended 12) |   |   | 	
| CPU Speed | 2.4GHz |   |   | 		
| RAM | 32GB |   |   | 		
|Disk Capacity | 200 GB	 |   |   | 	
| Disk IO Speed | 200 MBs  |   |   | 			
| RAID Level| 	10	 |   |   | 		
| LAN Interfaces | 	1	 |   |   |
