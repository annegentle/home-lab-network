# APIC-EM on Approved Cisco UCS Servers
You can find the approved Cisco Unified Computing System (UCS) servers on which to install APIC-EM near the top of the APIC-EM Installation Guide. For reference, if you want to look for yourself:

- A [page that should list the Installation Guides](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/cloud-systems-management/one-enterprise-network-controller/products-installation-guides-list.html) for all versions
- The [Installation Guide for APIC-EM V1.4.1.x](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/install_1-4-1-x/b_apic_em_install_guide_v_1-4-1-x.html) (used to build this Learning Lab)

## Overview of APIC-EM UCS Server Options
The APIC-EM installation guide for version 1.4.1.x lists three supported server models, as listed here. However, two of the models (the two with M3S in their names) have reached end-of-sales by Cisco, so focus on the first one in the list.

- [Cisco UCS C220 M4S](http://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en/us/products/collateral/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c-series-rack-servers/c220m4-sff-spec-sheet.pdf)
- [Cisco UCS M3S](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c220-m3-rack-server/index.html)
- [Cisco UCS C22 M3S](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c22-m3-rack-server/index.html)

(Also, for reference, [this page](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/ucs-c-series-rack-servers/models-comparison.html) shows a good comparison of different UCS C-series models.)

In case you have not looked at Cisco servers before as part of your job, a couple of tips can help you sift through the meaning.  In the product names, note that the three listed models begin with “C”, which for Cisco UCS servers means they are rack mounted servers. (B-series servers are blade servers.) Also, all three of these models end in S, which means that they use small form factor (SFF) disk drive bays, accommodating 2.5 inch drives. Sometimes, a matching L model (long form factor, or LFF) exists, with practically the same specifications as the similar S model, other than the L model using 3.5-inch drive bays.

## Example Server Configuration that Meets All APIC-EM Requirements
<<<<<<< HEAD
You could create a configuration for a Cisco UCS C220 M4S on your own by using [Cisco’s Commerce tool](https://apps.cisco.com/Commerce/guest), Or you could call your favorite Cisco reseller (or find one [here](https://www.cisco.com/go/partnerlocator/)).

- **Model:** The UCS C220 M4S chassis
- **Processor:** An [Intel E5-2620 CPU](http://ark.intel.com/products/64594/Intel-Xeon-Processor-E5-2620-15M-Cache-2_00-GHz-7_20-GTs-Intel-QPI).  As with all options chosen for this configuration, it was the cheapest option that met the minimum requirement (6 cores). Note that it has 12 threads.
- **LAN:** Two Gigabit Ethernet NICs – the C220 M4S has no LAN NICs built-in, but two PCIe expansion slots. The sample configuration adds a 2-port PCIe Gigabit NIC.
- **RAM:** 32 G RAM
- **Disk:** A 300 GB hard disk drive (HDD) with approximately 1200 MBs transfer rate. (If I were buying for my own lab, I’d buy disk with more capacity. Note that the server plenty of drive bays for later expansion.)

Although a popular enterprise product line, the list price of just under $10,000 of this example would probably drive away most of us thinking of using this server for a home APIC-EM installation. Even at a 30-40% discount, the price would still be too much for the average person to spend for a server to use in a home lab. However, if you’re willing to try hardware that’s not on the approved list, and maybe even hardware that does not meet all the listed requirements, you can get the price down quite a bit – so read on.
