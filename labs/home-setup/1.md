# APIC-EM Home Lab Hardware Platform

The first DevNet Learning Lab in this Module discusses some points to consider about whether to install APIC-EM in your home lab. That first Learning Lab discusses a normal learning progression of using the available free Learning Labs and DevNet Sandboxes, and then deciding when you feel like you need to add APIC-EM to your home lab. That Learning Lab then examines what you needed in your lab for APIC-EM software and for the network devices that will work with APIC-EM.

This Learning Lab in that same Module focuses on what may likely be your biggest barrier to deciding to add APIC-EM to your home lab: the cost of the server hardware on which to run APIC-EM. This Learning Lab begins with the assumption that you are at least considering whether to add APIC-EM to your home lab, including the fact that you have some budget set aside. What server hardware should you buy? What specifications? What could you choose to save some money? This Learning Lab works through some of those questions.

This Learning Lab breaks down the APIC-EM hardware requirements. It then shows a series of hardware options, some of which may not meet all the hardware requirements, for the sake of finding a lower price point for your APIC-EM server. Along the way, we ask you to take a few minutes and begin your own research, just to see what servers you might with current prices in your part of the world.

This Learning Lab makes assumptions and choices that impact the examples shown here: 

- Home not Work: The context is for your home lab, not for a lab at work that is connected to your enterprise network. While some of this Learning Lab’s discussions may be useful when building a lab at work, the home lab assumption drives the choices. 
- Low Cost: For anything that requires purchase, the prices should be at least possible for an individual’s budget rather than a company’s budget.
- APIC-EM V1.4.1.x: Hardware requirements may change over time, of course, and Cisco releases new versions of APIC-EM 2-3 times per year. This Learning Lab happened to use the then-latest version, 1.4.1.x, and its documentation, as the basis for the hardware requirements.
- Intel Processors (Mostly): Just to make the comparisons more obvious, the discussion keeps to Intel processors for the most part (with one exception). You can look for AMD processors when doing the exercises if that is your own preference.


This Learning Lab begins with a quick recap of some of the why/wherefore about your decision to install APIC-EM at home, and then spends the rest of the space on your server hardware decision.
