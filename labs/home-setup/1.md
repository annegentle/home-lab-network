# APIC-EM Home Lab Hardware Platform

The previous lab described some points to consider considering APIC-EM for your home lab. You can use the resources and learning progression of available free Learning Labs and DevNet Sandboxes, and then decide whether to add APIC-EM to your home lab. You can examine what you need in your lab for APIC-EM software and for the network devices that work with APIC-EM.

This lab breaks down the APIC-EM hardware requirements. It provides a series of hardware options, some of which may not meet all the hardware requirements, for the sake of finding a lower price point for your APIC-EM server. Along the way, take a few minutes and begin your own research just to see what servers you might with current prices in your part of the world.

Here are some assumptions and choices that impact the examples shown here: 

- **Home not Work:** The context is for your home lab, not for a lab at work that is connected to your enterprise network. While some of this Learning Lab’s discussions may be useful when building a lab at work, the home lab assumption drives the choices. 
- **Low Cost:** For anything that requires purchase, the prices should be at least possible for an individual’s budget rather than a company’s budget.
- **APIC-EM V1.4.1.x:** Hardware requirements may change over time, of course, and Cisco releases new versions of APIC-EM 2-3 times per year. This Learning Lab happened to use the then-latest version, 1.4.1.x, and its documentation, as the basis for the hardware requirements.
- **Intel Processors (mostly):** Just to make the comparisons more obvious, the discussion keeps to Intel processors for the most part (with one exception). You can look for AMD processors when doing the exercises if that is your own preference.


This lab starts with a quick recap of some of the reasons about your decision to install APIC-EM at home, and then spends the rest of the space on your server hardware decision.
