# APIC-EM on Intel NUC Mini Desktops
The previous page showed examples of how to get the APIC-EM server price down with generic rack-mount servers, as well as by relaxing the requirements a bit with not purchasing RAID hardware and by not using the CPU base clock rate as stated. This next page takes another step by examining mini-desktops, specifically the Intel NUC, which makes us relax the requirements even more – but with another significant reduction in price.

## How Much Processor Do We Really Need?
APIC-EM will work with less CPU than listed in the APIC-EM Installation docs, but using less CPU is a risk. The install docs list the minimum recommended system requirements. But in a home lab, if your budget was tight you might take a small risk to run an under-powered server to save your own money, hoping that your work in lab would not stress the system too much.

That strategy of course begs a question: how much hardware is enough for APIC-EM in your home lab?

First, there is a [post in the DevNet APIC-EM community](https://communities.cisco.com/thread/82355) that gives us all a place to discuss the idea of what people have used successfully for an APIC-EM home lab. We started this thread to help drive the conversation. In effect, the answer is that you can use whatever works. Hopefully, over time, that thread and others can help us all by listing people have successfully used in lab.

Also, thinking in terms of Intel’s server (XEON) and desktop/laptop Core series (I3/I5/I7), some of the Intel I3/5/7 series support several cores as well as two threads per core. In fact, the [Intel I7-6770HQ](http://ark.intel.com/products/93341/Intel-Core-i7-6770HQ-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_50-GHz)  has 4 cores with 8 threads, and finishes well in some benchmarks compared to the XEON E5-2620v4, which was featured in one of the rack-mount servers in the previous page.

The downside? As of the time this DevNet Learning Lab was published, the Intel Core series maxed out at 4 physical cores, which does not meet the literal requirements listed for APIC-EM. But if you might be willing to try less CPU, for less money, and see if it works for your needs, it is worth looking at the options. 

## Do Not Skimp on Both CPU Cores and Disk Speed
As you might expect, there is a low enough amount of CPU, RAM, disk space, and disk speed for which any software system would simply not work at all, or work so poorly as to be useless. However, the idea with this exercise is to determine if you could save some money on a few of the requirements, could the system still work.

When discussing this idea that the RAM, disk speed, and CPU do affect each other. That is, a system with a SATA1 drive (150MBs), which is less than the suggested 200MBs, would be less tolerant of a lower-powered CPU, say in comparison to a much faster SSD drive that had a >1GBs read speed.
So, for the purposes of this Learning Lab, this page shows examples with only 4 CPU cores. However, those examples never fall below 32G RAM and all use SSDs that far exceed the 200MBs transfer rate.

## About the Intel NUC Mini-Desktop Computer
The [Intel Next Unit of Computing (NUC)](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits.html)  is a brand for a family of mini-desktop computers, but with a bit of a twist. First, it is an Intel product, with Intel CPUs. The CPUs are traditional laptop/desktop CPUs, but not the Intel XEON server processors.

Second, some NUCs are a motherboard and processor (no chassis even), while others are a “kit” that includes a chassis with the motherboard already installed. None of the NUCs bought directly from Intel are completed desktop computers; you need to add a few components yourself. The kit’s chassis adds many features, with a variety of built-in connectors/features (USB, Gigabit Ethernet, HDMI, and so on). However, the kits do not come with RAM or disk drives.

So, how would you use a NUC for APIC-EM? If you are willing to do a little work with a screwdriver, you could make a working mini-desktop:

- Buy a kit with the best CPU choice for your needs
- Add 32G RAM
- Add Disk drive(s)


Intrigued? Here’s a great whirlwind tour that’s a [great 7-minute intro to the NUC](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/nuc-kit-nuc6i7kyk-features-configurations-video.html).

## Best NUC Options for APIC-EM Today
Finding the right NUC for your APIC-EM needs can take a little searching, although we do recommend a particular model here. One reason that you need to search is that Intel releases new versions of the NUC regularly. Additionally, Intel does not create a NUC for every Intel processor, so you cannot just pick the processor you prefer and build a NUC around it. As time passes, if you are interested in possibly using an Intel NUC for your home lab, start [with a search](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits.html).   

When looking for a good NUC for APIC-EM, you want to look for kits with the better CPUs – but your search may be easier if you begin by searching on the 32G RAM requirement (see next figure). The Intel NUC web page does not allow easy filtering on the number of cores in the processor, for instance, but it does filter on RAM supported – and at least today, most NUCs do not support 32G of RAM. A quick way to narrow the field to list only the most capable NUCs is to search on RAM, as highlighted below.

The [Intel NUC “Skull Canyon” (NUC6I7KYK)](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/boards-kits/nuc/kits/nuc6i7kyk.html) may be the best fit for APIC-EM as of the release of this Learning Lab. It supports 32G, and comes with the [6th generation Intel Core I7-6770 ](http://ark.intel.com/products/93341/Intel-Core-i7-6770HQ-Processor-6M-Cache-up-to-3_50-GHz) processor. The processor has 4 cores/8 threads with a base clock rate of 2.6 GHz.

Of course, the biggest downside is that it does not meet the stated requirement for 6 cores.

## LAN Options for the Intel NUC
One other consideration for the NUC has to do with LAN interfaces. The kits have a mix of LAN interfaces, some wireless, some wired. However, to get APIC-EM working, you can make APIC-EM work using only the single 10/100/1000 Ethernet NIC that comes with many Intel NUC Kits. Then you can just connect the APIC-EM NUC to your home lab subnet, and connect through a spare router to the lab network, as shown in this figure.

![alt text](/posts/files/home-lab-network/assets/images/apic-31.png )

Note that the NUC does have several options for additional LAN NICs. Many come with Wireless LAN NICs. The NUCs some with several USB 2.0, 3.0, 3.1, and even an Apple Thunderbolt interface, all of which can be used to add Ethernet interfaces. However, know that in the testing of APIC-EM on an Intel NUC when writing this Learning Lab, getting those additional Ethernet interfaces to work with APIC-EM required a fair amount of effort; they did not work immediately, and were not recognized by the APIC-EM installation process. If you know you want to use two or more LAN interfaces on your APIC-EM server, know that using a NUC will require some extra time to discover the details beyond what we were able to make work.

## Example Intel NUC Configuration: NUC Skull Canyon (NUC6i7KYK) Kit
With the Intel NUC Skull Canyon kit, plus well-chosen RAM and SSD, you can get a system that meets all the APIC-EM requirements except the 6-core requirement and the RAID disk requirement. This model of NUC does not support Hard Disk Drives (HDDs), rather supporting only the much smaller Solid State Drive (SSD), which are generally a little more expensive per byte). Even so, in the pricing exercise we did for this Learning Lab, adding 32 GB of RAM and a 250G SSD drive put the actual price at about $900 (without shipping and tax).

Beyond the details in the table, here are a few other comments about this example system:

- **Virtualization:** The CPU does support virtualization so that you could have 8 virtual CPUs when using a hypervisor.
- **Quiet:** It is a small device, and makes much less noise than a typical rack-mount server. That may or may not be a big deal, but people with home labs do sometimes complain about the noise if the gear is sitting near/in a living area.
- **LAN Effort:** Using more than the one embedded Ethernet port with APIC-EM may require more research/work.

## Exercise: Investigate Intel NUC for APIC-EM
If the Intel NUC option has you intrigued, take a look for yourself. The table again repeats the literal requirements from the 1.4.1.x installation document. You can choose where to relax our requirements (or not), and consider the current Intel NUC options. Check below the table for some handy links:


TABLE 3


| Requirement	| Value/Amount per 1.4.1x Installation Docs	| Requirements: NUC #1	| Requirements: NUC #2 |
|---|---|---|---|
| CPU Cores	| 6 (Recommended 12) |   |   | 	
| CPU Speed	| 2.4GHz		 |   |   | 	
| RAM	| 32GB	|  |   |   	
| Disk Capacity | 	200 GB |   |   | 			
| Disk IO Speed| 	200 MBs	 |   |   | 		
| RAID Level	| 10	 |   |   | 		
| LAN Interfaces	| 1		 |   |   | 	


Now that you have thought about your own plan, take a few notes as you work to confirm the now-current requirements for APIC-EM, what you decided to choose for your own specifications, and what the pricing looked like in your research.
