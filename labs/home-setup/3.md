# Server Hardware Requirements for APIC-EM 
For most of us, the cost of the server will be the biggest barrier to overcome before you run APIC-EM at home. To help you work through that, this Learning Lab examines the APIC-EM server hardware requirements, and then examines a variety of options at different price points.

## Three Environments on which to Run the APIC-EM System
APIC-EM software downloads as an ISO that can be installed natively on a server (that is, bare metal), as a virtual machine, or as an appliance. If a virtual machine, the APIC-EM documents list a single supported hypervisor: VMWare ESXi. Cisco also offers an appliance option, in which you purchase the appliance from Cisco; what you receive is a Cisco UCS server with the APIC-EM product already installed on the server.

For the bare-metal option, Cisco lists the approved server hardware choices. The hardware compatibility list includes a [short list of Cisco C-series UCS servers](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/install_1-4-1-x/b_apic_em_install_guide_v_1-4-1-x/b_apic_em_install_guide_v_1-4-1-x_chapter_011.html) (that is, rack mount servers). 

For the appliance, you buy the appliance, for which the hardware unsurprisingly happens to be one of the approved Cisco UCS C-series servers. For the VM option, you just download the APIC-EM installation file (an .ISO file), and install it as a VM under VMWare’s ESXi hypervisor.

## Server Hardware Requirements for APIC-EM
If you use bare-metal or a VM, you need to choose how much of each server resource to reserve for the APIC-EM system or VM. The next figure summarizes the key requirements (per the APIC-EM 1.4.1.x installation documents):

To make the comparisons more direct and more obvious, the next few pages focus on the bare-metal installation, assuming the requirements as shown in the figure.

## Community Discussion about Your APIC-EM Server Requirements
The [installation docs ](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/cloud-systems-management/application-policy-infrastructure-controller-enterprise-module/1-4-x/install_1-4-1-x/b_apic_em_install_guide_v_1-4-1-x/b_apic_em_install_guide_v_1-4-1-x_chapter_011.html#id_36793) require a given number of cores and so on. However, when you install APIC-EM on a server that has less than the required amount of resources, the installation works (with some error messages). And then APIC-EM may or may not work just fine in your home lab, which begs the question: how much CPU, RAM Disk and so on do you really need on a server to run APIC-EM in a home lab?

There may never be a single set answer to that question, but it can help to hear about other systems that people have used successfully in their labs. To that end, the following [post in the DevNet APIC-EM community]( https://communities.cisco.com/thread/82355) asks that very question. Make sure to check out the various comments to see what systems have worked for different people.

## Hardware for APIC-EM Vs. Other Lab VMs
This DevNet learning lab keeps its focus on a server to run APIC-EM on bare metal, just so the upcoming comparisons can be more direct and obvious. However, you will probably want to think about buying your server to run a hypervisor, like VMWare’s ESXi, and run multiple VMs in addition to running APIC-EM as a VM. For instance, you may want to:

- Buy a server with more power than APIC-EM needs
- Install ESXi
- Run an APIC-EM VM
- Run Cisco VIRL
- Run multiple CSR 1000v instances 

So, while working through the next few pages of this Learning Lab, be thinking about whether you might want to buy a server with more CPUs, RAM, and so on than you need for APIC-EM.

## Hardware Options Considered in this Learning Lab
The next few pages show a comparison between four reasonable options for server platforms to run APIC-EM. In particular:
1.	Approved Cisco UCS servers
2.	White box rack mount server options
3.	Mini-Desktops 
4.	Pre-Built and Build-Your-Own Desktops
