# Recap: To Install APIC-EM at Home, or Not?
Do you really need or want to install APIC-EM in your home lab? Even though the software itself can be downloaded for free, there is some time and money required to add APIC-EM to most home labs. 

This page recaps thoughts about your own decision of whether to add APIC-EM to your home lab, condensed from the more detailed discussion from DevNet Learning Lab, “APIC-EM Home Lab Decision, Software, and Networking Devices”. Here’s a quick recap in case you have not seen the other Learning Lab recently. 

## DevNet APIC-EM Learning Options
One reason why you might defer the choice to add APIC-EM to your home lab is that you can learn a lot at DevNet, so that you may not even need APIC-EM at home. In particular:

- [DevNet Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/apic-em-prog#net-controllers): Several of the DevNet Learning Labs teach network programmability using APIC-EM’s northbound REST APIs. It’s a great learning tool beyond being a great management platform. 
- [DevNet APIC-EM Sandboxes](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology?c=14ec7ccf-2988-474e-a135-1e90b9bc6caf):  DevNet also offers Sandboxes, which are lab pods with software and real and/or virtual instances of various networking hardware. The APIC-EM Sandboxes of course have APIC-EM pre-installed. 

## Reasons You Might Want to Install APIC-EM at Home for Learning
As wonderful as those DevNet and other learning tools are, the deeper you go, the more you will want to put APIC-EM in your home lab. The progression for many people is to learn APIC-EM at DevNet and eventually put APIC-EM in their lab at work (expecting to build skills and eventually move it to production), or to install it at home for self-learning. Here are some of the key reasons for wanting APIC-EM at home:

- Network Topology/Config: You control the network that APIC-EM discovers and manages.
- Availability: Your home lab should be available to you any time you want it!
- APIC-EM apps: The flexibility gained by controlling all parts of the network can enable more experimentation and learning with some of the APIC-EM apps
- APIC-EM Installation/Planning: If your goal is to learn about the install process, and some of the options, having your own server on which to install APIC-EM is a big help.

From here forward, the rest of this Learning Lab assumes you are pursuing adding APIC-EM to your home lab – let’s go find some hardware on which to run APIC-EM!
