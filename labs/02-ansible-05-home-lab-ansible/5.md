# Installing Ansible on your Desktop OS

From one perspective, Ansible is an agentless configuration management tool, which provides a domain specific language (DSL), and is used to automate the configuration and operation of IT resources. From another perspective, Ansible is also a Python application, existing as a set of Python modules, packaged so that it can be installed with PIP. 

With these two perspectives in mind, you can install Ansible with a **pip install** command. The next figure puts this installation into context with the other steps in this lab.

## Install Ansible with PIP

Use PIP to install Ansible into your virtual environment, as follows:

1.  Return to a command shell with the virtual environment already activated, in your project directory. If needed, open a new command shell, move to the AN01 project directory (**cd ~/AN01**), and activate your virtual environment (**source venv/bin/activate**).
2.  List the files in the venv/bin subdirectory with this command:
    **ls -l venv/bin**
3.  Notice that no commands that begin with “ansible” are available in that directory.
4.  Install Ansible using PIP, without a **sudo** preface: 
    **pip install ansible**. 
    > Warning: Do NOT use the **sudo** command before the **pip** command; doing so would install Ansible using PIP in the global environment, rather than the virtual environment.

5.  Look at the messages displayed during the PIP installation of Ansible, looking for other packages installed as dependencies. You should see PyYAML, paramiko, and jinja2, among others.
6.  Use the **pip list** command to list the installed libraries, checking to see Ansible is installed.
7.  List the files in the venv/bin subdirectory again. Notice that in this case, there should be a variety of files that begin with “ansible”.
8.  Keep the command shell open.

## Verifying the Ansible Installation

Next, try to use a few Ansible commands. Using an Ansible command from your virtual environment verifies that you can use the commands. These next steps show you the Ansible version, and reveal some information about where Ansible installed the files.

1.  Move to the same command shell you were using at the end of the previous lab steps. If you already closed it, open a new command shell, move to the AN01 project directory (**cd ~/AN01**), and activate your virtual environment (**source venv/bin/activate**).
2.  List the version of Ansible installed:
    **ansible --version**
3.  Examine the output of the **ansible --version** command to find the directory listed as the “Ansible Python module location”. The listed directory is where PIP installed the Ansible modules, and where the Ansible commands look for modules. Compare for similarity to the excerpt below.

    ```
    ansible python module location =
    /home/wendellodom/AN01/venv/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
    ```

4.  Examine the files in the directory you found in the previous step and compare the files to the list of Ansible modules listed in the [Ansible documentation](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html).

    For example, look for networking modules, and then modules for IOS. You should be able to find the same Ansible modules in the Ansible documentation, with the same categories, as found within your directory structure.

5.  You should be able to find this subdirectory within AN01/venv: `./ lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible/modules/network/ios`.

    > Note: Ansible modules have a file type of .py, confirming that the modules are written in Python. The next figure highlights one of those modules, ios_facts, used later in this lab.

6.  In the command shell, issue the **ansible -m ping localhost** command.

    This command uses a name “localhost”, which references the loopback address (127.0.0.1), and the Ansible ping module. Because you have not yet created an inventory file in the default location, you see some error messages. However, the end of the output should show a successful ping of your local host. The next figure shows a example:

7.  Keep your command shell open.

At this point, you can call Ansible commands from your virtual environment. The next few sections together show how to use a basic sample Ansible playbook to connect to a router in a DevNet Sandbox, by first creating and editing some values in an Ansible inventory file.
