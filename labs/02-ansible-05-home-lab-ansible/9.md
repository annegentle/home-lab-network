# Home Lab Network Design Options

The previous test confirms you have set up Ansible correctly on your desktop OS. Next, this lab provide background information about making Ansible work with a network device in your home lab. While the Ansible configuration is small, you need to consider how to connect your computer to your home lab so that you have SSH connectivity to the networking devices in your home lab.

>Note: This lab covers the same details as the DevNet Learning Lab [Home Lab: Using NETCONF/YANG from Your Desktop OS](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop/02-netconf-04-home-lab-netconf). If wanted, you may skip to “Using an Ansible Playbook to Extract Data from the Sandbox Router” in this lab.

## Traditional Connectivity from Your Computer to Your Home Lab

To get started, think about a typical networker’s home lab. First, the home has what many home networks have: an Internet connection and wireless and wired access for all the components to connect to the Internet. Call that the “family network”. A networker with a home lab also has a lab network with a variety of routers, switches, and other devices, called a “lab network” here.

A networker can keep the family and lab network separate or connect them in various ways. For instance, perhaps the networker only wants CLI access to each console. In that case, they can have one device act as an access server, which connects with console cable to the console of each lab network device, as shown in the next figure. The access server connects to the home network. The networker connects to the access server with Telnet or SSH, and then connects to each console to issue CLI commands.

## A Design with IP Connectivity to the Lab Devices

While the previous design works well for CLI access through device consoles, it does not provide IP access to each device. That is, the computer at which you run your Python code needs to send IP packets to the IP addresses of the lab devices and receive IP packets from those devices. For example, you could connect your computer to both the family network and to the lab network with Ethernet.

Also think about routing on your computer when using this design. The key points to consider are:

-   You want a default route with the home router (the router connected to the Internet) as the next-hop address so that your computer can reach destinations on the Internet.
-   Your family and lab networks both use private addressing, so you need to avoid overlaps.
-   You need routes on your computer for all the IP address ranges in the lab network as static routes.

For example, if your family network uses private network 192.168.1.0/24, your lab should avoid using that IPv4 network. You could add static routes on your computer for the entire private IP address range, with lab router R1 as the next-hop router. The routes would be for these destinations:

-   10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 (all of private network 10)
-   172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0 (all private networks from 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0)
-   192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 (all private networks from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0)

You could use other designs, but when thinking about using your desktop OS, Ansible, and your home lab’s networking devices, begin with this basic planning for IP connectivity and making sure the computer can ping all the lab networking devices.
