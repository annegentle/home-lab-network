While this lab focuses on installing Ansible and verifying that it works on your computer, you will need to learn more about Ansible. DevNet has some Learning Labs and Sandboxes to help you get started. This lab even uses one of the always on DevNet Sandboxes because it is a convenient tool for proving that you correctly installed a tool on your desktop OS. Take a look at some of the options.

##  DevNet Learning Labs

One way to find DevNet Learning Labs about any topic is to start at the DevNet Learning Labs page, and look at the list of tags on the left. The list includes all the tags applied to each lab by their author. [Just click on Ansible](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/labs/tags/Ansible/page/1) in this case to get the list of labs.

Of course, using a DevNet Learning Module or Track has the advantage of a list of suggested labs in a particular sequence. As of the time this lab was posted, the “[Introduction to Ansible](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/sdx-ansible-intro)” Learning Module includes four labs, with directions to do hands-on activities on the “Open NX-OS with Nexus 9000v” Sandbox (listed in the next section of this page).

Also, note that Ansible happens to be part of the current agenda for the “[DevNet Express for Data Center Infrastructure](https://developer.cisco.com/site/devnet/events-contests/events/?utm_source=DevNet_homepage&utm_campaign=mega%20menu%20%3E%20discover%20%3E%20events%20link)” events.

##  DevNet Sandboxes

If you search for a [DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/Saml/Index?ReturnUrl=/) using the word “Ansible”, you may not find many hits. However, the same DevNet Sandboxes useful for NETCONF/YANG experiments are often useful for Ansible experiments as well. Check out these Sandbox labs when looking for a place to learn:

   Always On “[NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology)” Sandbox: This sandbox includes a running IOS XE instance that is always running, so you have no need to VPN into the lab. Just connect to the URL with SSH to various ports to make use of different features. (Note that this lab and a similar [lab about NETCONF/YANG](https://learninglabs.cisco.com:8867/labs/02-netconfyang-04-home-lab-netconf-yang) both use this Sandbox as part of the Learning Lab.)

   Reservable “[NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/32b0ae9b-3960-469f-8852-2a03389063d9?diagramType=Topology)” Sandbox: The same idea as the Always On Sandbox described previously, but this one is reservable and adds a “Devbox” – a Linux host you can connect to with a remote desktop connection.

   Reservable “[Open NX-OS with Nexus 9000v](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1e9b57ff-9e64-4c68-93e5-f0f0a8c6f22c?diagramType=Topology)” Sandbox: This one gives you a four-node NX-OS design as implemented with Cisco VIRL along with a Devbox.

##  DevNet Open Device Programmability Community

Also, just to point you to where you can engage the DevNet folks about these topics: make sure to check out and follow the [Open Device Programmability community](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/odp) as well.
