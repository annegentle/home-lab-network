# Using an Ansible Playbook to Extract Data from Your Home Lab Devices

You will complete this lab by using another sample Ansible playbook, this time so it uses one router in your home lab. To do these steps as written here, you need:

-   One router running IOS or IOS XE
-   Willingness to configure the home lab router with an IP address so it is pingable from your home lab computer that is running Ansible
-   Willingness to configure the home lab router for SSHv2

If you have a willingness to set up that device in lab, jump in and try this last set of steps.

## Configure and Use SSH to Your Home Lab Router

These next steps hit the highlights of what you should do to set up your home lab router. Make sure to SSH to the router, to populate your SSH known hosts file with the hostname or IP address of your router.

1.  Create a topology, IP configurations, and routes, so that you can ping your home lab router from your desktop OS.
2.  Configure the router to support SSHv2.
3.  Open a new command shell. You do not need to start the virtual environment in this shell.
4.  Use the **ssh** command to login to your home lab router. If using IP address 192.168.1.79, with username “wendell”, as shown in the samples with this lab, use the command: **ssh -l wendell -2 192.168.1.79**
5.  If prompted as to whether to trust this computer, answer “yes”, which places the host into the SSH known hosts file, which is necessary for Ansible to work correctly.
6.  Leave this command shell open, because it is used in the next lab steps.

## Editing the Inventory File to Match the Home Lab Router’s Credentials

This page uses a sample playbook (test-to-homelab.yml) from the GitHub repo for this lab, plus the sample inventory file (my-inventory). This playbook is almost identical to the playbook used to test with the Sandbox router, in that it extracts the device’s hostname and OS version. The difference is that it does so to devices in your home lab, which requires different parameters, like the SSH username/password you configured for your home lab router.

This figure shows the parts of the sample my-inventory file important to this playbook. The playbook operates against a group of hosts named “sandbox”, as defined in the inventory file. The inventory file also defines some obvious variables, used by the playbook, but the values sit here in the inventory file.

This final exercise walks you through the process of running the playbook to connect to your home lab router. First, you will need to change the my-inventory file to match what you configured on your home lab router. Once changed, you can run the test-to-homelab.yml playbook, and compare that output to commands from your SSH connection to the same router, as follows:

1.  This lab assumes that you have done the earlier lab steps to download the [GitHub repo for this lab](http://www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01) and editing the inventory file (my-inventory) line that references the Ansible python interpreter.
2.  Confirm the values you configured on your lab router for:
  -   The IP address (192.168.1.79 in the examples in this lab)
  -   The username (wendell in the examples in this lab)
  -   The password (odom in the examples in this lab)
3.  Using any editor, edit the my-inventory sample inventory file, (located in the project subdirectory /AN01 off your home directory) and change the matching values per your lab router. Save your changes to the file.
4.  Arrange your two command shells on your screen:
    -   On the left: The shell with the virtual environment enabled, current directory /AN01.
    -   On the right: Your SSH connection into your home lab router. (If the SSH connection timed out, connect again.)
5.  Move to the virtual environment command shell on the left.
6.  Issue the **ansible-playbook test-to-homelab.yml -i my-inventory** command. This command:
    -   Processes playbook test-to-homelab.yml
    -   Uses the my-inventory file
7.  The output may take 10-20 seconds to populate, and look something like this next sample:

8.  Note the text “ok” beside the tasks. Of particular importance, the second task’s “ok”, for the ios_facts task, is the task that connects to the Sandbox router to issue commands and extract information about the router.
9.  Move to the window with the SSH session to the same router. Check the hostname per the command prompt, and use the **show version** command to check the version, and compare these values to what you saw with Ansible.
