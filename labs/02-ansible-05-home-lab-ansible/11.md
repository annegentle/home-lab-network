# Using an Ansible Playbook to Extract Data from Your Home Lab Devices

In this lab you use another sample Ansible playbook, this time with a router in your home lab. To do so, you need:

-   One router running IOS or IOS XE.
-   Ability to configure the home lab router with an IP address that is pingable from the home lab computer running Ansible.
-   Ability to configure the home lab router for SSHv2.

If you can set up that device in your home lab, try this last set of steps.

## Configure and Use SSH to Your Home Lab Router

These next steps describe how to set up your home lab router. You SSH to the router to populate your SSH `known_hosts` file with the hostname or IP address of your router.

1.  Create a topology, IP configurations, and routes so that you can ping your home lab router from your desktop OS.
2.  Configure the router to support SSHv2.
3.  Open a new command shell on your desktop OS. You do not need to start the virtual environment in this shell.
4.  Use the **ssh** command to login to your home lab router. For example, with a router IP address `192.168.1.79` and username `wendell`, use the command: **ssh -l wendell -2 192.168.1.79**
5.  If prompted, answer “yes”, which places the host into the SSH `known_hosts` file, as required for Ansible to connect.
6.  Leave this command shell open for use in the next lab steps.

## Editing the Inventory File to Match the Home Lab Router’s Credentials

This page uses a sample playbook `test-to-homelab.yml` from the GitHub repo for this lab, plus the sample inventory file `my-inventory`. This playbook is similar to the playbook used to extract the device’s hostname and OS version with the Sandbox router. The difference is that it uses your home lab parameters, such as the SSH username/password you configured for your home lab router.

This figure shows the parts of the sample `my-inventory` file relevant to this playbook. The playbook operates against a group of hosts named “sandbox” as defined in the inventory file. The inventory file also defines variables used by the playbook, configured in the inventory file.

This exercise describes the process of running the playbook for your home lab router. First, change the my-inventory file to match what you configured on your home lab router. Once changed, you can run the `test-to-homelab.yml` playbook and compare that output to commands from your SSH connection to the same router, as follows:

1.  This lab assumes that you have done the earlier lab steps to download the [GitHub repo for this lab](http://www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01) and edit the inventory file `my-inventory` to reference the Ansible python interpreter.
2.  Confirm the values you configured on your lab router for:
  -   The IP address (`192.168.1.79` in my home lab)
  -   The username (`wendell` in my home lab)
  -   The password (`odom` in my home lab)
3.  Using any editor, edit the `my-inventory` sample inventory file located in the project subdirectory /AN01 off your home directory to change the matching values for your lab router. Save the `my-inventory` file.
4.  Arrange your two command shells on your screen:
    -   On the left: the shell with the virtual environment enabled, in current directory AN01.
    -   On the right: use SSH to connect to your home lab router. (If the SSH connection timed out, reconnect.)
5.  Move to the virtual environment command shell on the left.
6.  Issue the **ansible-playbook test-to-homelab.yml -i my-inventory** command. This command:
    -   Processes playbook `test-to-homelab.yml`
    -   Uses the `my-inventory` file
7.  Wait 10-20 seconds for the output, and compare to this sample:

8.  Note the text `ok:` for each task. The second task is the `ios_facts` task, which connects to the home lab router to issue commands and extract information about the router.
9.  Move to the window with the SSH session to the same router. Check the hostname per the command prompt, and use the **show version** command to check the version.
10. Compare these values to the left-hand shell with Ansible output. The values should be the same.
