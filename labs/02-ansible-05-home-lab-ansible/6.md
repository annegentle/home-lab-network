# Building a Basic Ansible Inventory File

Ansible uses a configuration file to store Ansible settings and an inventory file to describe the devices being managed with related variables about those devices. This section describes how to build a basic inventory file. In the next section, you add to the inventory file to prove you can run an Ansible playbook that uses a router in the DevNet Sandbox.

## Download Sample Files from GitHub

This lab uses three sample Ansible files that are packaged in a [GitHub repo](https://www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01). The repo holds these files:

-   **my-inventory**: A sample inventory file.
-   **test-to-sandbox.yml**: An Ansible playbook that tests Ansible with a DevNet Sandbox router.
-   **test-to-homelab.yml**: An Ansible playbook that tests Ansible with a router in your home lab.

Copy the files into your project directory (~/AN01). If you know enough about Git to do that on your own, go ahead. If not, these steps guide you through a process using the GitHub UI, without requiring Git or a GitHub account.

1.  On your Linux desktop, open Firefox (or any browser).
2.  Open the link to the GitHub repo in the browser: [www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01](https://www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01)
3.  Click the **Clone or download** button and then click **Download ZIP**.

4.  After downloading the GitHub repo as a zip file, uncompress and copy the files directly into the /AN01 project directory (and not into a subdirectory of /AN01). You can use a file manager or commands within the command shell.

5.  Use a Linux file manager or commands from terminal to verify the three files shown in the next figure are in the /AN01 project directory.

## Editing the Inventory File to Match Your Virtual Environment

An Ansible inventory file can keep several important settings, primarily names and variables about each host being managed. Next, you should confirm two settings, and optionally change one of them for your own preference. The settings:

**Run the ACS locally**: The ACS is the Ansible Control Server. This setting tells Ansible to run locally, meaning that the Ansible Control Server is on this local computer.

**Python Interpreter**: This setting tells Ansible the directory of the Python interpreter to use.

1.  Return to the command shell within a current directory of ~/AN01 that has the virtual environment enabled.
2.  Issue the **which python** command, to list the directory from which your virtual environment executes the **python** command. Copy this listing for the Python Interpret setting.
3.  Using any editor (for example, on Ubuntu, gedit or vim), edit the sample inventory file `my-inventory` in the /AN01 project directory.
4.  Using an editor, open the `my-inventory` file and look at the `ansible_connection` and `ansible_python_interpreter` settings.

> Note: The `ansible_connection` setting should remain “local” so that the Ansible ACS resides on the same computer where you run your Ansible programs. You could change the setting for the Python interpreter to point to the specific filename of the Python executable in your virtual environment, as described in the next step. However, with the setting of `usr/bin/env python`, Ansible should already execute the same Python shown in that earlier **which python** command.

5.  Optionally, change the directory listed as the “ansible_python_interpreter” to match the directory in the first line of output of the **which python** command, for example:

    ```
    ansible_python_interpreter=/home/wendellodom/AN01/venv/bin/python
    ```

6.  Save any changes to the `my-inventory` file.

## Running Commands that Reference the Inventory File

Ansible has a default location and name for the inventory file: `/etc/ansible/hosts`. However, many people use a separate inventory file, stored in a different directory. To make use of a different inventory file, reference the inventory file in the Ansible command. For this lab, you copied the inventory file `my-inventory` into the ~/AC01 directory.

This next task tries two Ansible commands that act locally (meaning, the commands make no attempt to communicate with a networking device). The first command repeats the earlier Ansible ping module, and the second command gathers information about the Ansible Control Server. In this case, with the current `ansible_connection=local` setting, the ACS is the same computer on which you issue the **ansible** command.

1.  Return to the same command shell you have been using, which should have a current directory of ~/AN01, and have the virtual environment enabled.
2.  Repeat the **ansible -m ping localhost** command, but with a reference to the inventory file:
    **ansible -m ping localhost -i my-inventory**
    -   Notice that this command no longer gives the same error messages as the earlier attempt.
    -   If you wanted to use an inventory file not in the current directory, you can reference the entire path. For example:
        **ansible -m ping localhost -i ./some/other/directory/my-inventory**
    -   You should see the word “SUCCESS” when pinging your computer’s loopback address. If not, troubleshoot the network settings on the VM.
3.  Use the Ansible setup module to list many configuration settings for the Ansible Control Server, which is your own computer, while also listing your new inventory file:
    **ansible -m setup localhost -i my-inventory**
    -   This command returns a large amount of output, but if you scroll through it, you can see recognizable facts like your computer’s interfaces and IP addresses.
