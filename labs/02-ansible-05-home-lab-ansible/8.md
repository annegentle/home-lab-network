# Using an Ansible Playbook to Extract Data from the Sandbox Router

Now it’s time to use Ansible for its most traditional job: to run a playbook. An Ansible playbook is a list of tasks, calling different Ansible modules, directed against groups of hosts or individual hosts. For this step, to prove that Ansible works with the router in the always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox, run the sample playbook and confirm the results.

## Editing the Inventory File to Match the Sandbox Router’s Credentials

This page uses one sample playbook, `test-to-sandbox.yml`, from the GitHub repo for this lab, plus the sample inventory file `my-inventory`. To run this lab, you do not need to understand the playbook, but as an an explanation, the playbook:

-   Uses the `ios_facts` module to connect to the sandbox router with SSH and extract information about the router.
-   Uses the `debug` module to describe the router hostname and IOS version.

This figure shows the parts of the sample `my-inventory` file required to make this playbook work. The playbook operates against a group of hosts named “sandbox”, as defined in the inventory file. The inventory file also defines some variables used by the playbook, and the values are defined in the inventory file.

The values in the figure for hostname, username, password, and port number match the DevNet Sandbox configuration when this lab was released. However, check the DevNet Sandbox documentation in case values have changed and change the values in the inventory file to match. These steps guide you through the process:

1.  This lab assumes that you have already downloaded the [GitHub repo for this lab](http://www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01), copied the files to the project directory (AN01), and edited the inventory file `my-inventory`. If you did not, complete the steps in “Building a Basic Ansible Inventory File”.
2.  Open a web browser tab to view the documentation for the always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. Record the values for:
  -   The hostname (currently `ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com`)
  -   The username (currently `root`)
  -   The password (currently `D_Vay!\_10&`)
  -   The non-default SSH port number (currently `8181`)
3.  Using any editor (for instance, the pre-installed gedit or vim), edit the sample inventory file `my-inventory`.
4.  If the values in the `my-inventory file` are different in the current Sandbox documentation, change to matching values.
5.  Save the `my-inventory` file.

## Run the Sample Ansible Playbook to Get Data about the Sandbox Router

You can now run the playbook! For this exercise, you run the playbook in a command shell with the virtual environment enabled, and in another shell, use SSH to connect to the CLI of the router. Then you can compare results of the playbook with CLI commands.

1.  Arrange two command shells on your screen:
    -   On the left: the shell with the virtual environment enabled, in current directory AN01.
    -   On the right: use SSH to connect to the DevNet Sandbox. (If the SSH connection timed out, reconnect.)
2.  In the left-hand shell, issue the **ansible-playbook test-to-sandbox.yml -i my-inventory** command. This command:
    -   Processes playbook `test-to-sandbox.yml`
    -   Uses the `my-inventory` file
4.  Wait 10-20 seconds for the output, and compare to this sample:

5.  Note the text `ok:` for each task. The second task is the `ios_facts` task, which connects to the Sandbox router to extract information about the router.
6.  Move to the right-hand shell with an SSH session to the same router.
7. Check the hostname in the command prompt, and use the **show version** command to check the version.
8. Compare these values to the left-hand shell with Ansible output. The values should be the same.
9.  Leave the left-hand command shell open to use in later lab steps, or be ready to open a new shell and reactivate the environment.
