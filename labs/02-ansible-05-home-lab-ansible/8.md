# Using an Ansible Playbook to Extract Data from the Sandbox Router

Finally! It’s time to use Ansible for its most traditional job: to run a playbook. An Ansible playbook is a list of tasks, calling different Ansible modules, directed against groups of hosts or individual hosts. For this step, just to prove to yourself that Ansible works with the router in the router in the always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox, you will run the sample playbook and confirm the results.

## Editing the Inventory File to Match the Sandbox Router’s Credentials

This page uses one sample playbook (test-to-sandbox.yml) from the GitHub repo for this lab, plus the sample inventory file (my-inventory). To make the lab work, you do not need to understand the details in the playbook, but as an overview, the playbook:

-   Uses the ios_facts module to connect to the sandbox router with SSH and extract information about the router
-   Uses the debug module to print messages about the router hostname and IOS version

This figure shows the parts of the sample my-inventory file important to make this playbook work. The playbook operates against a group of hosts named “sandbox”, as defined in the inventory file. The inventory file also defines some obvious variables, used by the playbook, but the values sit here in the inventory file.

The values in the figure for hostname, username, password, and port number match the DevNet Sandbox as of when this lab was released. However, you need to check the DevNet Sandbox documentation, and if these values have changed, you need to change the values in the inventory file to match. These steps guide you through the process:

1.  This lab assumes that you have already downloaded the [GitHub repo for this lab](http://www.github.com/WendellOdom/devnet-ansible-01), copied the files to the project directory (AN01), and edited the inventory file (my-inventory) per an earlier page in this lab. If you did not, you will need to backtrack to complete the steps on the page titled “Building a Basic Ansible Inventory File”.
2.  Open a web browser tab to view the documentation for the always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. Record the values for:
  -   The hostname (currently ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com)
  -   The username (currently root)
  -   The password (currently D_Vay!\_10&)
  -   The non-default SSH port number (currently 8181)
3.  Using any editor (for instance, the pre-installed gedit or vim), edit the sample inventory file (my-inventory).
4.  If the values in the my-inventory file for hostname, username, password, or port are different in the current Sandbox documentation, change the matching values per the figure just above.
5.  Save any changes to the my-inventory file.

## Run the Sample Ansible Playbook to Get Data about the Sandbox Router

You should now be ready to run the playbook! For this exercise, you can run the playbook in the command shell with the virtual environment enabled, and beside it, use the shell on which you used SSH to connect to the CLI of the router. Then you can compare results of the playbook with traditional CLI commands.

1.  Arrange your two command shells on your screen:
    -   On the left: The shell with the virtual environment enabled, current directory AN01.
    -   On the right: SSH into the DevNet Sandbox. (If the SSH connection timed out, connect again.)
2.  Next work from the virtual environment command shell on the left.
3.  Issue the **ansible-playbook test-to-sandbox.yml -i my-inventory** command. This command:
    -   Processes playbook test-to-sandbox.yml
    -   Uses the my-inventory file
4.  The output may take 10-20 seconds to populate, and look something like this next sample:

5.  Note the text “ok” beside the tasks. The second task’s “ok”, for the ios_facts task, is the task that connects to the Sandbox router to issue commands and extract information about the router.
6.  Move to the window on the right that has the SSH session to the same router. Check the hostname per the command prompt, and use the **show version** command to check the version, and compare these values to what you saw with Ansible. They should of course be the same values.
7.  Leave the command shell with the virtual environment open, as it is used in later lab steps. (Or be ready to open a new shell and reactivate the environment.)
