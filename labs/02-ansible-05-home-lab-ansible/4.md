# Prepare a Python 2.7 Virtual Environment

This section describes the Python version and environment needed to run Ansible. It provides considerations for which version of Python to use, and describes Python virtual environments for Python 2.7. (If you choose Python 3.x, refer to the next section in this lab.)

## Choose Which Python Version/Release to Use

You can use Ansible with Python 2 or 3, specifically Python 2.7, 3.5, or 3.6. Ansible version 2.2 added [support for Python 3.x](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/python_3_support.html) (namely, Python 3.5 and later). Because Ansible code and modules are written in Python, you must be precise in your selection of Python and Ansible versions used or you may uncover issues. Using Python 2.7 may be safer than using 3.5 or 3.6, because Ansible users have spent more time and fixed more issues with Ansible modules using Python 2.7 compared to Python 3.x. Summarizing some of the decision points:

-   You can get started with either Python 2.7 or Python 3.5/3.6
-   If using Python 3.x, it must be 3.5 or later
-   Using a virtual environment makes it easier to update to some other version of Python later
-   For the most caution, prefer Python 2.7 over Python 3.5/3.6

The steps on this page set up a virtual environment for Python 2.7 for Ansible. To use Python 3.x, use the same steps listed on this page, but substitute **python3** for **python**.

## A Few Notes about Virtual Environments for Ansible

Virtual environments provide many useful features. As a good habit with Python, use a virtual environment for each project. This lab shows the creation and use of a virtual environment for this lab, added to a subdirectory named AN01 (shorthand for Ansible lab 1), as shown in the next figure.

You may choose not to use a virtual environment, but the lab steps assume the use of the virtual environment. Check out the second lab in [Home Lab: Setting up Your Desktop OS for Network Programmability](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop) for more background info about PIP and virtual environments.

## Install/Refresh the Virtualenv Package with PIP

To make sure that you can create the virtual environment no matter where you begin, these steps walk through the process of installing (or refreshing) the virtualenv package. This section assumes you have Python 2.7 and PIP already installed. To install the `virtualenv` tool for Python 2.7:

1.  From your Linux desktop, open a new command shell.
2.  Confirm the default Python 2.7 release and PIP version with these commands:
  -   **python -V **
  -   **pip -V**
3.  Use PIP to install `virtualenv`:
    **sudo -H pip install virtualenv**
4.  Confirm the `virtualenv` installation:
    **python -m virtualenv --version**
5.  Keep the command shell open.

Next, create the virtual environment.

## Create the Virtual Environment

When creating the virtual environment now that you have installed `pip` and `virtualenv`, make an /AN01 subdirectory off your home directory to store files for this lab project. Then use the `virtualenv` command to add a /venv subdirectory in which to create the virtual environment, as shown.

Follow these steps to create and activate the virtual environment:

1.  From your Linux desktop, open a new command shell.
2.  If needed, move to your home directory using this command:
    **cd ~**
3.  Confirm your current directory:
    **pwd**
4.  Create (make) the new lab exercise project directory:
    **mkdir AN01**.
5.  Move to the AN01 subdirectory as the current directory:
    **cd AN01**.
6.  Create the virtual environment into the “venv” subdirectory:
    **virtualenv venv**
    While the virtualenv tool works, you see installation messages in the terminal.
7.  Keep the command shell (terminal) open.

## Activate and Use the Virtual Environment

At this point, the virtual environment exists, ready for you to activate and use. This section works through the activation and library installations with PIP using Python within the virtual environment.

Follow these steps to activate the virtual environment.

> Note: Use the same steps each time you want to reactivate and use the virtual environment.

1.  From the Linux desktop, continue using the same command shell, or open a new one as needed.
2.  Ensure you are in the /AN01 subdirectory in your home directory. To be sure, use these commands:
  -   **cd ~/AN01**
  -   **pwd**
3.  Activate the virtual environment by executing the “activate” script in the virtual environment’s directory. The table shows the commands for both activation and deactivation, assuming the virtual environment is in the /venv subdirectory.

4.  Confirm the version of Python available to this virtual environment by listing the directory from which your OS would run the Python interpreter with this command: **which python**
5.  Keep the command shell open to continue using the virtual environment.

When finished with the virtual environment at any time, either close the command shell or use the deactivate command to deactivate it. Repeat the steps in this sequence to reactivate it.

> Note: You can activate the virtual environment no matter the current directory of the command shell. The steps list specific directories to make sure the navigation is clear.
