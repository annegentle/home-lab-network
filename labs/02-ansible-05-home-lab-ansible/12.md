# Summary

Congratulations! Now you should be ready to start experimenting on your own with Ansible, from your own Linux host. When you do a lab exercise or read a web page with examples, you can try something similar in your own lab.

As usual, DevNet has some great resources to help you along that path – here are a few links if you want to get into more Ansible right now:

-   Do the DevNet Learning Labs in the “[Introduction to Ansible](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/sdx-ansible-intro)” Learning Module
-   Watch some [On-Demand Cisco Live presentations](https://www.ciscolive.com/online/connect/search.ww#loadSearch-searchPhrase=ansible&searchType=session&tc=0&sortBy=&p=) about Ansible

Also, keep an eye out for new DevNet Learning Labs with an Ansible theme!
