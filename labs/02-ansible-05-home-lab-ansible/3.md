# Verify Your Ansible Linux Host

As the first step in this DevNet Learning Lab, make sure you have a working Linux instance to use in your home lab, with a few apps available. For long-term Linux users, you should be able to glance at this page and move on. For the rest of us, this page talks through the major tasks to provision a Linux VM along with some basic desktop setup.

Note: This page does not teach all the concepts required to launch a Linux VM on your Windows or Mac host. Refer to your virtualization tool documentation if needed.

## Install a Linux VM if Needed

Do you plan to use a separate Linux instance for this lab? If so, and you are comfortable with adding a new VM using a tool on your computer, then this step should be simple and painless. Even if not, learning about a desktop virtualization tool and then installing a Linux image is beneficial. This section hits the highlights.

First, choose whatever desktop virtualization tool you want to use on your native OS. Here are a few:
-   VMWare Fusion (Mac)
-   VMWare Workstation (Windows)
-   Virtual Box (Both)
-   XenDesktop (Both)
-   Vagrant (Both)

Install a Linux Desktop image as a new VM. As a pre-requisite, you need to have connectivity to reach your home network and the Internet. For testing this lab, we used the latest [Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). Download the image from the page, and then install it as a new VM. For CPU and memory settings, use the defaults at installation – no need to increase them.

Once installed, start your Linux image to prepare for the next steps.

## Ensure Useful Apps are Available

You need to use a few Linux apps that come with most Linux desktops. To prepare the system beforehand, configure your editor and command shell.

First, this lab requires you to open a command shell. On a Linux system, it typically means to open the “terminal” application. The terminal app may not be shown on the desktop by default, so follow these steps to make it available.

Note: These steps assume you have installed an Ubuntu desktop image as referenced earlier. Adjust as needed for the Linux desktop you use.

1.  From your Linux desktop, click the “Search Your Computer” icon. Usually this icon is in the upper left side of the desktop.

2.  Once the search box is open, type “terminal” to display the icon of the terminal app.
3.  Drag-and-drop the terminal app to the series of the icons on the left (called the Launcher). This action makes the icon permanently visible on your desktop. You can launch (start) the app from the icon.

In addition, you need to edit a few text files in this lab. If you are comfortable using the vim command line editor, use it from the command shell (terminal). If you prefer an editor with a graphical interface, install any editor you like. However, if using Ubuntu, search for the gedit editor as it should already be installed. Make the icon available on your desktop using the same search, drag, and drop process used for the terminal app.

For reference, the next figure shows the apps used in this lab, arranged neatly on the desktop.

## Confirm Python and PIP are Installed

Most Linux distributions have Python 2.7 already installed. The package manager PIP (Pip Installs Python) may be installed, and if not, you should add it. For example, the Ubuntu desktop image used to test this lab came with Python version 2.7.12, but not PIP. Check a few facts about Python 2.7 and PIP on your Linux host, and make sure both are installed before moving on.

1.  On your chosen Linux system, login to the desktop. When using a VM, connect to the console using your virtualization tool.
2.  From the Linux desktop, open a command shell (terminal).
3.  Use these commands to confirm your default Python 2.7 version and PIP version:
  -   **python -V**
  -   **pip -V**

For example, when installing a new Ubuntu desktop, observe that Python 2.7 is installed, but PIP is not installed. If you are missing PIP (or Python), you can refer to DevNet Learning Lab “[Home Lab: Python Libraries (PIP) and Virtual Environments](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop/02-pip-ve-02-home-lab-pip-virtual-environment/step/1)” for more information. To install PIP, refer to this [documentation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Or as shown in this Ubuntu example, run the `sudo apt install python-pip` command to install PIP.

## Confirm Internet Connectivity to the DevNet Sandbox

For this lab, you work mostly from a Linux command shell and occasionally from a web browser on your Linux host. Before moving on to the rest of the lab, test your Internet connectivity by connecting to the DevNet Sandbox used later in this lab exercise.

1.  Open any web browser on your Linux desktop. (On the Ubuntu desktop, you can open Firefox.)
2.  In that browser, open this link: [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology).
3.  Login to DevNet as needed, and make sure you see the DevNet Sandbox documentation. If not, troubleshoot the connectivity for web pages opened in the Linux desktop.
