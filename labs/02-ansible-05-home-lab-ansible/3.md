# Verify Your Ansible Linux Host

As the first step in this DevNet Learning Lab, you need to make sure that you have a working Linux instance to use in your home lab, with a few apps ready to use. For you long-term Linux users, you should be able to glance around this page and quickly move on to the next web page of this lab. For the rest of us, this page talks through the major tasks to get a Linux VM up and working, along with some basic desktop setup. Note that this page does not attempt to teach all the skills required to understand bringing up a Linux VM on your Windows or Mac host, assuming you have those skills prior to using this lab.

## Install a Linux VM if Needed

Do you plan to use a separate Linux instance for this lab? If you are somewhat comfortable with adding a new VM to a desktop virtualization tool on your computer, then this step should be simple and painless. Even if not, reading about a desktop virtualization tool, and then installing a free Linux image, is not a huge item to learn. This page hits the highlights.

First, choose whatever desktop virtualization tool you want to use on your native OS. Just to list a few:
-   VMWare Fusion (Mac)
-   VMWare Workstation (Windows)
-   Virtual Box (Both)
-   XenDesktop (Both)
-   Vagrant (Both)

Install a Linux Desktop image as a new VM. For instance, for testing this lab, we used the latest [Long-Term Support (LTS) release of Ubuntu Desktop](https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop). If you like, just download the image, and install it as a new VM. You will not need a lot of CPU or memory (take the defaults at installation – no need to increase them), and you will need to have connectivity so that you can reach your home network and the Internet.

Once installed, go ahead and start your Linux image to get ready for the next steps.

## Ensure Useful Apps are Available

You will need to use a few Linux apps that come with most Linux desktops. But just to prep the system beforehand, do these few steps to consider your editor and command shell.

First, this lab repeatedly asks you to open a command shell, which on a Linux system typically means to open the “terminal” application. The terminal app may not be shown on the desktop by default, so to make it handy, follow these steps. (Note that these steps assume you have installed an Ubuntu Desktop image as referenced earlier on this page, so adjust as needed for the Linux desktop you are using):

1.  From your Linux desktop, click the “Search Your Computer” icon, usually in the upper left of the icons on the side of the desktop.

2.  Once the search box is open, type “terminal”, which displays the icon of the terminal app.
3.  Drag-and-drop the terminal app to the series of the icons on the left (called the Launcher), so it will always be visible on your desktop. You can launch (start) the app from the icon.

Additionally, you will need to edit a few text files during this lab. If you are comfortable using the vim command line editor, use it from the command shell (that is, from terminal). If you prefer to use an editor with a graphical interface, you can install any editor you like. However, you might search for the gedit editor if using Ubuntu – it should already be installed. All you should do is make the icon available on your desktop, by using the same search process you just used for the terminal app.

The next figure shows the apps referenced in this lab at some point, arranged together, for reference.

## Confirm Python and PIP are Installed

Most Linux distributions have Python 2.7 already installed. PIP may or may not be installed, but it is easy enough to add it. For instance, the Ubuntu Desktop image used to test this lab came with Python 2.7.12 installed, but without PIP. Before moving on, you should check a few facts about Python 2.7 and PIP on your Linux host, and make sure both are installed before moving on to the next page.

1.  On your chosen Linux system, login to reach the desktop. If using a VM, you should be able to connect to the console using your virtualization tool to display your Linux desktop.
2.  From the Linux Desktop, open a command shell (that is, the terminal app).
3.  Use these commands to confirm your default Python 2.7 version and PIP version:
  -   **python -V**
  -   **pip -V**

For example, when installing a new Ubuntu Desktop OS as a VM, you might see the following results. Notice that the commands confirm that Python 2.7 is installed, but that PIP is not installed. If you are missing PIP (or even Python), you can refer to DevNet Learning Lab “[Home Lab: Python Libraries (PIP) and Virtual Environments](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop/02-pip-ve-02-home-lab-pip-virtual-environment/step/1)” for more background. To install PIP, refer to this [documentation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/). Or as shown in this image, you could just run the suggested command to install PIP as shown at the bottom of this next figure.

## Confirm Internet Connectivity to DevNet Sandbox

For this lab, you will work mostly from a Linux command shell and occasionally from a web browser session from your Linux host. As a test of Internet connectivity before moving on to the rest of the lab, test your Internet connectivity by connecting to DevNet, to the DevNet Sandbox used later in this lab exercise.

1.  Open any web browser on your Linux desktop. (If using the Ubuntu desktop mentioned on this page, you can use Firefox browser.)
2.  Open this link in a tab in that browser: [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology).
3.  As needed, login to DevNet, and try the link again until you see the DevNet Sandbox documentation in your browser.
4.  Troubleshoot until you can connect to DevNet from a browser on your Linux desktop.
