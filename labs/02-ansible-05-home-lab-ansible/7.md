# Adding Entries to Your SSH Known Hosts File

Next, prepare Ansible to connect to a router in a DevNet Sandbox with an SSH client. Connecting to the router with an SSH client adds the router’s hostname to a file used by SSH, called the `known_hosts` file. Adding a host’s name to this file enables Ansible to connect to the same host with SSH.

## The DevNet Always-On NETCONF/YANG Sandbox

The always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox runs one instance of IOS XE, a Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000v instance. This Sandbox also works for testing Ansible from your computer, because the Sandbox provides a router that is always available through SSH, with no VPN connection required.

For this lab’s purposes, use SSH in two ways:

-   Connect to the router using an SSH client to add the remote host to its `known_hosts` file. The upcoming Ansible commands need that entry in the `known_hosts` file to work correctly.
-   Ansible uses SSH to connect to that same router, on the same SSH port. You must supply Ansible with all related SSH login parameters, like hostname, username, password, and any non-default port number.

By default, SSH uses port value 22. The DevNet Sandbox IOS XE instance uses a different port value and a NAT/PAT function between your computer and the Sandbox, as shown. When testing Ansible using this Sandbox, you need to configure Ansible to use the port number 8181.

## SSH from an SSH Client to the Sandbox

To begin, login to the Sandbox router using the credentials listed in the Sandbox documentation. Also, the first time you SSH to that router, the SSH connection displays a question, "Are you sure you want to continue connecting?" To answer “yes,” you must type `y-e-s`. Typing `yes` adds the hostname to the list of known hosts, enabling the Ansible commands for that hostname and port value to work.

If the Sandbox credentials have not changed, you can use the same command from your Linux host. To ensure you can login to the Sandbox router with SSH, follow these steps from your Linux host:

1.  Open a web browser tab to view the documentation for the always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. Record the values for:
  - The hostname (currently `ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com`)
  - The username (currently `root`)
  - The password (currently `D_Vay!\_10&`)
  - The non-default SSH port number (currently `8181`)
2.  Open a new command shell. You do not need to start the virtual environment in this shell.
3.  Use the **ssh** command to login to the Sandbox router, using the parameters you discovered from the Sandbox documentation. With current values, the command is:
    **ssh -l root -p 8181 -2 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com**
4.  If prompted, answer “yes”, which places the host into the SSH `known_hosts` file, which is necessary for Ansible to connect.
5.  Leave this command shell open, to use in the next lab steps.
