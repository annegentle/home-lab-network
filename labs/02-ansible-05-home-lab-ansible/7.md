# Adding Entries to Your SSH Known Hosts File

Next, you will prepare Ansible to use SSH to a router in a DevNet Sandbox by first connecting to that router with some SSH client. Connecting to the router with an SSH client adds the router’s hostname to a file used by SSH, called the known hosts file. Adding a host’s name to the known hosts file is one quick and easy way to enable Ansible to succeed in also connecting to the same host with SSH.

## The DevNet Always-On NETCONF/YANG Sandbox

The always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox runs one instance of IOS XE, namely a Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000v instance. Although the Sandbox title implies nothing about Ansible, this Sandbox also works well for testing Ansible from your computer. The reason is that the Sandbox provides a router that is always available via SSH, with no VPN connection required.

For this lab’s purposes, you will use SSH in two ways:

-   Connect to the router using an SSH client, which causes your computer to add the remote host to its known hosts file. The upcoming Ansible commands need that entry in the known hosts file before they will work correctly.
-   Ansible will use SSH to connect to that same router, on the same SSH port. You will need to supply Ansible with the related SSH login parameters, like hostname, username, password, and any non-default port number.

By default, SSH uses well-known port 22. The DevNet Sandbox IOS XE instance uses a different port and a NAT/PAT function between us and the Sandbox, as shown in the figure. So, when testing Ansible using this Sandbox, you will need to tell Ansible to use a different port number.

## SSH from an SSH Client to the Sandbox

To begin, you should login to the Sandbox router using the credentials listed in the Sandbox documentation. Also, as an important side-effect, the first time you SSH to that router, the SSH connection will display a question, to which you should answer “yes”. As noted in one of the response messages, answering yes adds the hostname to the list of known hosts, which then allows the Ansible commands that reference that same hostname + port number to work.

If the Sandbox credentials have not changed, you could use the same command in the above sample. However, follow these steps to make sure you can login to the Sandbox router with SSH from your Linux host:

1.  Open a web browser tab to view the documentation for the always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. Record the values for:
  - The hostname (currently ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com)
  - The username (currently root)
  - The password (currently D_Vay!\_10&)
  - The non-default SSH port number (currently 8181)
2.  Open a new command shell. You do not need to start the virtual environment in this shell.
3.  Use the **ssh** command to login to the Sandbox router, using the parameters you discovered from the Sandbox documentation. If unchanged since this lab was written, the command should be: **ssh -l root -p 8181 -2 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com**
4.  If prompted as to whether to trust this computer, answer “yes”, which places the host into the SSH known hosts file, which is necessary for Ansible to work correctly.
5.  Leave this command shell open, because it is used in the next lab steps.
