Once you can ping each home lab networking device from your desktop OS, you can configure the device to support NETCONF/YANG. First, choose physical or virtual devices that support NETCONF/YANG. Then configure SSH and enable NETCONF. Here are details for configuring IOS XE, with links to additional information about IOS XR and NX-OS.

## Networking Devices that Support NETCONF/YANG

Before you can experiment hands-on, you need at least one networking device that supports NETCONF/YANG. You can use the DevNet Sandboxes for that purpose, and not add networking devices to your home lab. However, when you add those devices to your lab, you start with the devices that support NETCONF as well as YANG models. Be ready for that list of supported devices to grow and change.

First, check the [list of supported devices](https://developer.cisco.com/site/standard-network-devices/) published at DevNet. Scroll down to find both the list of physical and virtual devices, software versions, and links to the configuration guide docs for each. The next image shows the list as of the time this lab was written.

To build a home lab to support NETCONF/YANG, you do have some options. If you have some used physical devices from the list with compatible software, great! That said, many physical devices in the list are expensive compared to most home lab budgets. But there are options within reach of many home lab budgets.

You can use the [Cisco CSR product](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/cloud-services-router-1000v-series/index.html?dtid=osscdc000283), which is what DevNet uses in the always on NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE sandbox. You could purchase a basic low-throughput license and run it in your home lab. You can also run one or more CSR instances within a cloud service, and pay for the CSR licenses by the hour, as you can see with [this price chart](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B00EV8VXG2) from Amazon Web Services. Also, look for 60-day free trials for the CSR from Cisco, which works well for labs. (Additionally, you can download [Nexus 9000v](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/switches/nexus-9000v-switch/index.html?dtid=osscdc000283) for testing.)

Cisco’s [VIRL Personal Edition](https://learningnetworkstore.cisco.com/virtual-internet-routing-lab-virl/cisco-personal-edition-pe-20-nodes-virl-20) (VIRL PE) provides a great option as well. You can run identical CSR software within VIRL, as well as NX-OS and IOS XR. With VIRL, there are some costs: the annual license for VIRL itself ($200/year so far), plus the need to run it on a separate server rather than your desktop or laptop adds some expense to set up a server. But VIRL can be a great tool for many home labs.

On this page, the examples assume that you are configuring IOS XE, probably in the form of a CSR.

## Configuring SSH on IOS XE

To support NETCONF, begin by enabling SSH on the device. For a networker who has configured SSH support before, the configuration should be familiar. To support NETCONF/YANG, the device must support SSH Version 2. Also, the user must be placed in privilege level 15 once logged in (that is, XE puts the user in enable mode). To meet those requirements when using local usernames:

-   The **username** command must include parameters of **privilege 15**, which places the user into enable mode upon login.
-   The SSH server defaults to support both versions 1 and 2, but to meet the requirement, use either the **ip ssh version** command (to support both versions 1 and 2) or the **ip ssh version 2** command.

The following configuration shows an example configuration with all the necessary features for SSHv2.

```
username DevNet privilege 15 secret DevNet8*

! Enable SSH inbound only, and use of the local usernames
line vty 0 15
 login local
 transport input ssh

! Need hostname and domain name for key generation to work
hostname CSR1
ip domain-name example.com

! Create key, and enable SSH Version 2 only
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
ip ssh version 2
```

## Testing SSH to Your Network Device

To test SSH on your lab devices, you can use the same SSH app or command line client used previously in this Learning Lab. Or, once configured from the CLI of the device, you could test from the device’s CLI, using the IOS XE **ssh** command. For example, use the SSHv2 command below which defaults to use TCP port 22, username DevNet, to the networking device with address 10.1.1.1:

```
ssh -v 2 -l DevNet 10.1.1.1
```
To confirm that SSH has been configured correctly, look for a prompt for the password and login with the defined password.

## Configuring and Verifying NETCONF/YANG on IOS XE

To enable NETCONF/YANG on IOS XE today add is the **netconf-yang** global command. This command enables the NETCONF server so that you can do the same experiments shown earlier in this lab, as done with the always-on DevNet Sandbox.

To verify the proper operation of NETCONF on your lab device, repeat some of the earlier verification steps from this lab. For instance, you could use any SSH client to connect to the device’s port 830 (NETCONF’s default port), from which you should receive back a Hello message in XML format. Or, use the sample Python program offered with the always-on DevNet sandbox. Use the Python program to pass parameters for the host name/address, password, username, and port number.

The next example shows two sample commands you could use to test your home lab router’s NETCONF/YANG support. The first tests the NETCONF server with an SSH to the well-known NETCONF port (830). The other command calls the same sample program from earlier in this lab, this time with the IP address of the home lab router, and the username/password as shown in the configuration sample earlier on this page.

```
ssh -v 2 -l DevNet 10.1.1.1 –p 830
!
python NC-get-config.py –host 10.1.1.1 -u DevNet -p 'DevNet8*'
```

## NETCONF Configuration on IOS XR and NX-OS

To learn more about XE or NX-OS, check out more detail from a couple of places.

First, DevNet keeps a page focused on [Standard Device Interfaces](https://developer.cisco.com/site/standard-network-devices/) – a generic title that includes NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF topics. This is the same page that lists the devices that support NETCONF/YANG. The listings for devices that run IOS XR and NX-OS include links to the associated configuration guides. On that page, scroll to the devices and OS versions you want to read about, and click the links.

Second, a new DevNet Learning Lab that explains how to configure NETCONF/YANG on XR and NX-OS is either just released or about to be released as of the time this lab was released. So rather than repeat the details here, this lab defers to this upcoming new lab – just search at DevNet for NETCONF/YANG Learning Labs.
