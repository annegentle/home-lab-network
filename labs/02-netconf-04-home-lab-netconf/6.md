# Home Lab Network Design Options

So far, this DevNet Learning Lab has relied on a CSR1000v instance running IOS XE in a DevNet Sandbox. That works great for testing, but at some point, you may want to do some experiments with devices in your own home lab. This lab now turns towards your own Cisco device instances in your home lab, with one page of this lab about three major requirements. First, this page looks at the issues about providing IP connectivity from your desktop OS to the network devices in your lab. The next page then looks at network device configuration to support NETCONF/YANG.

## Traditional Connectivity from Your Computer to Your Home Lab

To get the conversation started, think about a typical networker’s home lab. First, the home has what any home network would have: An Internet connection, wireless and wired access, and so on, for all the components to let the family connect to the Internet. I’ll call that the “family network”. But a networker with a home lab also has a lab network with a variety of routers, switches, and other devices, which I’ll call a “lab network”.

A networker can keep the family and lab network separate, or connect them in various ways. For instance, often the networker only wants CLI access to each console. In that case, they could have one device act as an access server, which connects via console cable to the console of each lab network device, as shown in the next figure. The access server would connect to the home network. The networker could connect to the access server with Telnet or SSH, and then connect to each console, for the purpose of issuing CLI commands.

## A Design with IP Connectivity to the Lab Devices

While the previous design works well for traditional CLI access through device consoles, it does not provide IP access to each device. The PC at which you run your Python code needs to be able to send IP packets to the IP addresses of the lab devices, and receive IP packets back from those devices. For example, you could connect your computer to both the family network and to the lab network with Ethernet – simple enough.

You also must think about routing on your computer when using this design as well. The key points to consider that then impact your choices are:

-   You will want a default route with the home router (the router connected to the Internet) as the next-hop address so that your computer can reach destinations in the Internet.
-   Your family and lab networks both use private addressing, so you now need to avoid overlaps.
-   You need routes on your computer for all the IP address ranges in the lab network, as static routes.

For example, your family network could be using private network 192.168.1.0/24. Given that, your lab should avoid using that IPv4 network. Then you could add static routes on your computer for the entire private IP address range, with lab router R1 as the next-hop router. The routes would be for these destinations:

-   10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 (all of private network 10)
-   172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0 (all private networks from 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0)
-   192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 (all private networks from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0)

You could of course use other designs, but when thinking about using your desktop OS, NETCONF/YANG, and your home lab’s networking devices, begin with this basic step of planning the IP connectivity and making sure the computer can ping all the lab networking devices.
