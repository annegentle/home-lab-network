# Home Lab Network Design Options

So far, this DevNet Learning Lab has relied on a CSR1000v instance running IOS XE in a DevNet Sandbox. At some point, you may want to do some experiments with devices in your own home lab rather than a DevNet Sandbox. To that end, investigate your Cisco device instances in your home lab, looking at the major requirements. First, look at the issues in providing IP connectivity from your desktop OS to the network devices in your lab. Next, look at network device configuration to support NETCONF/YANG.

## Traditional Connectivity from Your Computer to Your Home Lab

As in the Ansible connectivity discussion, think about a typical home lab. First, the home often has an Internet connection with wireless and wired access for all components for family devices connecting to the Internet. Call that the “family network”. A networker with a home lab also has a lab network with a variety of routers, switches, and other components, referred to here as a “lab network”.

A networker can keep the family and lab networks separate or connect them in various ways. For instance, often the networker only wants CLI access to each console. For CLI access, they could have one device, an access server, which connects via cable to the console of each lab network device, as shown in the next figure. The access server would connect to the home network. The networker could connect to the access server with Telnet or SSH, and then connect to each console, to issue CLI commands.

## A Design with IP Connectivity to the Lab Devices

While an access server design works for traditional CLI access through device consoles, it does not provide IP access to each device. The computer at which you run your Python code needs to be able to send IP packets to the IP addresses of the lab devices and receive IP packets back. For example, you could connect your computer to both the family network and to the lab network with Ethernet.

Also think about routing on your computer when using this design. The key points that impact your choices are:

-   You want a default route with the home router (the router connected to the Internet) as the next-hop address so that your computer can reach destinations in the Internet.
-   Your family and lab networks both use private addressing, so you need to avoid overlaps.
-   You need static routes on your computer for all the IP address ranges in the lab network.

For example, your family network could be using private network 192.168.1.0/24. Given that, your lab should avoid using that IPv4 network. You could add static routes on your computer for the entire private IP address range, with lab router R1 as the next-hop router. The routes would be for these destinations:

-   10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 (all of private network 10)
-   172.16.0.0 255.240.0.0 (all private networks from 172.16.0.0 through 172.31.0.0)
-   192.168.0.0 255.255.0.0 (all private networks from 192.168.0.0 through 192.168.255.0)

You could use other designs, but when thinking about using your desktop computer, NETCONF/YANG, and your home lab’s networking devices, begin with this basic planning for the IP connectivity and making sure the computer can ping all the lab networking devices.
