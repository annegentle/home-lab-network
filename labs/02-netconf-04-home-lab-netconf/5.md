# Test the Python ncclient Library from Your Computer to the Sandbox

DevNet supplies some sample code along with the always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. The sample programs use a NETCONF Python library called `ncclient`. This section runs one of the sample programs, focusing on the underlying `ncclient` library as a tool.

## ncclient Basics

In programming, often an existing library provides useful functionality such as `nccclient`. The [ncclient](http://ncclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (NETCONF client) resides on the same computer as your Python code. Rather than sifting through such details as XML schemas, NETCONF RPC methods, and SSH connection management, the `ncclient` library offers simpler calls to Python modules.

One proof of the power of `ncclient` is that you can run sample code using the library on your computer, with limited knowledge about how NETCONF/YANG works, and get an idea of what the sample code does for you. Running that sample code  can prove that you are ready to learn the details of NETCONF/YANG.

## Exercise: Python Library Installation and Verification

The sample programs available with the always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox require a PIP installation to help with dependencies. The initial steps assume you need to re-activate your virtual environment from earlier in the lab. If you still have that virtual environment activated, you can skip to the first **pip** command.

1.  Open a command prompt (or use the existing one).
2.  Change directories to move to the project directory for this lab (NC01). For example, **cd NC01** from your home directory.
3.  Activate the virtual environment by executing the **activate** script in the virtual environment’s directory, using the appropriate command from the following table. The commands assume the virtual environment installed in the /venv subdirectory.

4.  Use PIP to install `ncclient` and the `argparse` library. With the virtual environment activated, PIP installs the libraries into the Python Library path for that virtual environment, rather than the global environment. To do so:

  -   **pip install ncclient**
  -   **pip install argparse**

5.  Confirm details about the packages, including the documentation for each: 

  - **pip show ncclient**
  - **pip show argparse**

## Exercise: Using ncclient

Download the DevNet Sandbox sample code from GitHub and then copy one program in your NC01 directory. After making a few edits, run the program.

First, download, place, and edit the program:

1.  Use a web browser to view the always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) Sandbox.
2.  Under Instructions, find the list of sample interfaces within the heading “Hello World”.
3. Click the link for "[Basic NETCONF Get](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/python_code_samples_network/tree/master/NC-get-config)”. This sample retrieves the running config from a device and clicking the link goes to the GitHub repository for the sample code.
4.  Copy the Python file to your computer using any method you choose into a file of the same name `NC-get-config.py` in the NC01 directory you set up earlier.
5.  Edit the file to change a **print** command to work in Python 3.6 as well as Python 2.7. The sample code uses a **print** statement with Python 2.7 syntax, and updating to the newer Python 3.x syntax works when using either Python 2.7 or 3.x. Look for the last line in the `NC-get-config.py` file and add parentheses in the print statement. Use this sample for comparison.
```
# Old last line of program with no ()
print xmlDom.toprettyxml(indent="  ")
#
# New last line of program with added ()
print(xmlDom.toprettyxml(indent="  "))
```

Now you are ready to run the program in your virtual environment following these steps:

1.  Move to the command shell with an activated virtual environment for this lab.
2.  Make sure your current directory is the NC01 subdirectory where you placed the `NC-get-config.py` file. If not, change directories.
3.  As an extra confirmation step, list the files in the directory that begin with NC:
  -   (Windows): **dir NC>***
  -   (Linux/Mac): **ls -l NC>***
4.  Run the sample Python file with no parameters: **python NC-get-config.py** and then read the provided help text. That help describes how to pass the key parameters: hostname, username, password, and port number, as shown in this sample of the output:
```
usage: NC-get-config.py [-h] --host HOST [-u USERNAME] [-p PASSWORD] [--port PORT]
```
5.  Run the Python program again, passing the parameters for the IOS XE instance in the always-on DevNet NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF Sandbox. With the current Sandbox configuration, use:
  -   (Windows): **python NC-get-config.py --host ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com -u root -p “D_Vay!_10&” --port 10000**
  -   (Linux/Mac): **python NC-get-config.py --host ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com -u root -p 'D_Vay!_10&' --port 10000**
6.  Examine the XML data returned by the program. Within the XML tags you should see many familiar commands. If you want, use SSH to login to the same XE instance directly, and use the **show running-config** command to list and compare that output to the XML displayed by the sample Python program.

Congratulations! You have just used NETCONF/YANG from a Python program on your computer, and you are ready to learn more.
