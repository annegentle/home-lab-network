# Summary

At this point, you should have a little deeper understanding of the tools that the NETCONF/YANG labs at DevNet ask you to use when performing different lab steps. Hopefully, any labs that use the ncclient library, or ask you to begin with SSH connections to network devices, will be more familiar and more comfortable to you.

Of course, the whole point is to help you in learning about NETCONF/YANG – so here are a few good next steps to learn more:

> [Adam Radford’s NETCONF/YANG Blogs](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/dna/blog/2017/01/04/next-generation-network-device-programming-part1): Adam has a couple of introductory blog posts on NETCONF/YANG, with some details about the use of SSH to test NETCONF in the device – check out those posts.
>
> [NETCONF/YANG Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/netprog-eng): As mentioned a few times in this lab, check out the labs in the “Introduction to Device Level Interfaces” Learning Module.
>
> [Yang Development Kit](https://developer.cisco.com/site/ydk/documents/overview/) (YDK): Ready to go a little deeper? Once you understand NETCONF/YANG, you will likely want to read more about Cisco’s YANG Development Kit (YDK). It strives to help simplify many of the functions you might try to implement, and it provides a large number of samples.
