# Summary

At this point, you should have a deeper understanding of the tools used when performing lab steps for DevNet Learning Labs. Hopefully, any labs that use the ncclient library or ask you to begin with SSH connections to network devices are more familiar and comfortable.

The whole point is to help you in learning about NETCONF/YANG – so here are a few good next steps:

[Adam Radford’s NETCONF/YANG Blogs](https://communities.cisco.com/community/developer/dna/blog/2017/01/04/next-generation-network-device-programming-part1): Adam has a couple of introductory blog posts on NETCONF/YANG, with some details about the use of SSH to test NETCONF in the device.

[NETCONF/YANG Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/netprog-eng): As mentioned in this lab, check out the labs in the “Introduction to Device Level Interfaces” Learning Module.

[Yang Development Kit](https://developer.cisco.com/site/ydk/documents/overview/) (YDK): Ready to go a little deeper? Once you understand NETCONF/YANG, you likely want to read more about Cisco’s YANG Development Kit (YDK). It strives to simplify many of the functions to implement, and provides a large number of samples.
