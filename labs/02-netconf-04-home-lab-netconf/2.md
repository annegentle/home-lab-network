DevNet provides some great Learning Labs for getting started with NETCONF/YANG as well as DevNet Sandboxes. This lab uses one of the always-on DevNet Sandboxes with a running IOS XE instance configured to support NETCONF/YANG. This section reviews the options available when this lab was written, and given the amount of activity and change in the NETCONF/YANG space you should do your own discovery also.

## DevNet Learning Labs

DevNet provides a starter Learning Module for NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF. The module, titled “[Introduction to Device Level Interfaces](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)”, introduces the topics and then contains one lab each on YANG, NETCONF, and RESTCONF.

You can find this module in a couple of different DevNet Learning Tracks today. Learning Tracks help guide us through a useful sequence of lab exercises at DevNet, so these useful labs show up in multiple places. You can find them in:

-   The “[Programming the Digital Network Architecture](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/programming-dna)” Learning Track
-   The “[Network Programmability for Network Engineers](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/netprog-eng)” Learning Track

## DevNet Sandboxes

DevNet maintains several Sandboxes useful for NETCONF/YANG experimentation. The best place to begin is the always-on “[NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology)” Sandbox. That URL provides access so you can:

-   SSH to the always-on IOS XE instance, with no need to connect to a DevNet VPN first.
-   Connect using sample programs provided with the Sandbox.
-   Use your own code, on your own computer, using NETCONF/YANG to manage the device in this Sandbox (following a code of conduct for the sandbox).
-   Find links to those same NETCONF DevNet Learning Labs.

You can use several other sandboxes as well, and the list will change, so search for yourself. Of interest:

[A Reservable NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on XE Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/32b0ae9b-3960-469f-8852-2a03389063d9?diagramType=Topology): Provides the same technologies as the always-on Sandbox, but is reservable and adds a “Devbox” – a Linux host you can connect to with a remote desktop connection.

[IOS XE on Catalyst 9000](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/18115a77-67d8-47f7-a0e0-b829ea75ff82?diagramType=Topology): A reservable Sandbox to experiment with XE, running on a Catalyst 9000 switch, with a Devbox.

[IOS XE Programmability](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/7fd27b24-7034-477d-9ad2-e2c8096dd1a5?diagramType=Topology): A reservable Sandbox with a CSR XE image and a Devbox.

[Open NX-OS with Nexus 9000v Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1e9b57ff-9e64-4c68-93e5-f0f0a8c6f22c?diagramType=Topology): This Sandbox provides a four-node NX-OS design as implemented with Cisco’s VIRL, along with a Devbox.
