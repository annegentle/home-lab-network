Unsurprisingly, DevNet provides some great Learning Labs for getting started with NETCONF/YANG as well as DevNet Sandboxes. In fact, this lab uses one of the DevNet Always-On Sandboxes – one that has a running IOS XE instance configured to support NETCONF/YANG – as a tool for testing your desktop or laptop OS tools. This section runs through the options that existed when this lab was written, but you should do you own searches as well, given the amount of activity and change in the NETCONF/YANG space.

## DevNet Learning Labs

DevNet provides a wonderful four-lab Learning Module to get you started with NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF. The module, titled “[Introduction to Device Level Interfaces](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/intro-device-level-interfaces)”, introduces the topics in the first lab, followed by one lab each on YANG, NETCONF, and RESTCONF.

You can find this module in a couple of different DevNet Learning Tracks today. Learning Tracks help guide us through a useful sequence of lab exercises at DevNet, and it is no surprise that these useful labs show up in multiple places. You can find them in:

-   The “[Programming the Digital Network Architecture](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/programming-dna)” Learning Track
-   The “[Network Programmability for Network Engineers](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/netprog-eng)” Learning Track

## DevNet Sandboxes

DevNet gives us several Sandboxes useful for NETCONF/YANG experimentation. Probably the best place to begin today is the Always On “[NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology)” Sandbox. Just clicking through shows you the URL from which you can:

-   SSH to the always-on IOS XE instance, with no need to VPN into DevNet first
-   Connect using sample programs provided with the Sandbox
-   Use your own code, on your own computer, using NETCONF/YANG to manage the device in this Sandbox (but follow the good citizen code of conduct for the sandbox)
-   Find links to those same NETCONF DevNet Learning Labs

You can use several other sandboxes as well, and the list will likely change and grow over time, so make sure to search for yourself. Of interest:

[A Reservable NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on XE Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/32b0ae9b-3960-469f-8852-2a03389063d9?diagramType=Topology): The same idea as the always on Sandbox just mentioned, but this one is reservable, and adds a “devbox” – a Linux host you can connect to with a remote desktop connection.

[IOS XE on Catalyst 9000](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/18115a77-67d8-47f7-a0e0-b829ea75ff82?diagramType=Topology): A reservable Sandbox to experiment with XE, running on a Catalyst 9000 switch, with a Devbox.

[IOS XE Programmability](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/7fd27b24-7034-477d-9ad2-e2c8096dd1a5?diagramType=Topology): A reservable Sandbox with a CSR XE image and a Devbox.

[Open NX-OS with Nexus 9000v Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/1e9b57ff-9e64-4c68-93e5-f0f0a8c6f22c?diagramType=Topology): This one gives you a four-node NX-OS design as implemented with Cisco’s VIRL, along with a Devbox.
