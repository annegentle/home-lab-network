# Prepare a Python 3.x Virtual Environment

From here forward, this DevNet Learning Lab walks through steps to prepare for NETCONF/YANG experiments. That process begins with thinking about the Python version, some Python libraries to install, and a Python virtual environment, all discussed on this page.

## Evaluating Which Python Version/Release to Use

For real life, the question of the specific version/release of Python to use when working with NETCONF/YANG will likely change over time as with any decision of what software version to use. So, when writing this lab, I asked around with some of the experts for some advice, but keep in mind that the answer may well change over time and in different conditions:

-   Use Python 3.x versus 2.7
-   For Python 3.x versions, use 3.6 by preference
-   If you have Python 2.7 but not Python 3.x versions installed, and just want to get started, use the latest 2.7 releases, preferably 2.7.12 or later

For the purposes of this lab exercise, you can use Python 2.7, 3.5, or 3.6. However, with the combination of factors that might impact which commands and parameters work in certain environments for Windows, Linux, and Mac, this lab shows steps that use your computer’s default Python 3 interpreter. The exercise steps ask you to create a virtual environment using that default Python 3.x version, which helps simplify the later lab steps (besides being useful as an end to itself).

For those of you who want to do this lab, but use a non-default Python 3.x installed on your system, you should create a virtual environment that instead uses that other Python 3.x version. After that, the rest of the lab steps that use an activated virtual environment should work as listed here. To do so, check the [virtualenv documentation](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/). Or, for example, if on a Linux system, your default Python 3.x was a pre-installed release pf Python 3.5, but you had also installed one release of Python 3.6, the command **virtualenv venv --python=python3.6** would create a virtual environment that uses the Python 3.6 interpreter.

Finally, for those of you who prefer to use the default Python 2.x version on your system, you can also still do this lab. Just use the same steps listed on this page, but substitute the following:

-   (Windows): For each command that begins **py -3**, use **py -2** instead.
-   (Linux/Mac): For each command that begins **python3**, use **python** instead.

## Considering the Use of a Virtual Environment for this Lab

As discussed in Learning Lab “Home Lab: Python Libraries (PIP) and Virtual Environments” in this same [Learning Module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop), virtual environments provide many useful features, and it can be a good habit to use a virtual environment for each project. This lab shows the creation and use of a virtual environment throughout the lab, as another chance to exercise those skills. Additionally, once created, you can just use the **python** and **pip** commands knowing that these commands apply to the virtual environment, as shown in the next figure.

You may of course choose to do the lab and not use a virtual environment, but the lab steps assume the use of the virtual environment as shown here. Check out the second lab in the “[Home Lab: Setting up Your Desktop OS for Network Programmability](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop)” Learning Module, for the lab about PIP and virtual environments, for more background info.

## Exercise: (Re)Installing the Virtualenv Package

Just to make sure that no matter where you begin, you can create the virtual environment, this next set of steps walks through the process of installing (or refreshing) the virtualenv package. This section assumes you have Python 3.x and the associated PIP already installed.

At this step, you will use PIP to attempt to install the virtualenv package for the default Python 3.x version on your system. Your attempt should either install virtualenv for the first time, or give you a message telling you it is already installed. To (re)install the virtualenv tool for Python 3.x:

1.  Open a new command shell/prompt (for Windows, [start the shell as an administrator](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813(v=ws.10).aspx))
2.  Use the following commands to confirm your default Python 3.x version.
  -   Windows: the **py -3 -V** command
  -   Linux/Mac: the **python3 -V** command

3.  Call PIP for the default Python 3 with these commands. Note that this step installs the default python 3.x interpreter into the virtual environment.

  -   (Windows): the **py -3 -m pip install virtualenv** command
  -   (Linux/Mac): the **sudo -H python3 -m pip install virtualenv** command

4.  Confirm that the virtualenv tool is installed, and can be called from Python 3.x, with these commands. (The commands list the version of the virtualenv package.)

  -   (Windows): **py -3 -m virtualenv --version**
  -   (Linux/Mac): **python3 -m virtualenv --version**

5.  If using Windows, close the command shell, because later steps do not need to be run as administrator.

At this point, you should be ready again to create the virtual environment.

## Exercise: Creating the Virtual Environment

This next lab steps assumes you either already had installed the virtualenv tool, or did the steps above to (re)install the tool for Python 3.x.

Next, create one new /NC01 subdirectory off your home directory, as a place to keep files for this lab exercise. You will then create a new virtual environment, whose files reside in the /venv subdirectory, as shown in the following figure.

![alt text](/posts/files/02-netconf-04-home-lab-netconf/assets/images/desktop-4-04.png)


Under those assumptions, follow these steps to create and activate the virtual environment:

1.  Open a new command shell/prompt.
2.  If not already there, move to your home directory using these commands:

  -   (Windows): **cd %HOMEPATH%**
  -   Linux/Mac: **cd ~**
3.  Confirm the value of your home directory with these commands:

  -   (Windows): **cd**
  -   (Linux/Mac): **pwd**
4.  Create (make) the new lab exercise project directory: **mkdir NC01**.
5.  Move to that directory as the current directory with the **cd NC01** command.
6.  Create the virtual environment that uses the default Python 3.x on your system, with “venv” as the directory name, with these commands:

    -   (Windows) Use the **py -3 -m virtualenv venv** command.
    -   (Linux/Mac) Use the **python3 -m virtualenv venv** command.
7.  Leave the command shell open.

## Exercise: Activating and Using the Virtual Environment

At this point, the virtual environment exists in files, but needs to be activated so you can install libraries with PIP, run Python within the environment, and so on. This last part of the page works through those last steps. Each time you use the virtual environment, you would repeat the steps to activate the virtual environment.

1.  Continue using the same command prompt.
1.  If not already there, change directories to move to the project directory (for example, **cd NC01** if you are in your home directory)
```
(Note: in everyday use, you do not have to change directories to use the virtual environment; the steps use a specific directory so that the commands that list directories are correct relative to the current directory.)
```
3.  Activate the virtual environment by executing the **activate** script in the virtual environment’s directory, using the appropriate command from the following table. The commands assume the virtual environment installed in the venv subdirectory.

4.  To confirm the version of Python that you will use with this virtual environment, use the python -V command.
5.  Leave the command shell open for now. However, when finished with the virtual environment at any time, just close the command shell, or use the commands in the table to deactivate it. When you return, repeat the steps in this sequence to reactivate it.
