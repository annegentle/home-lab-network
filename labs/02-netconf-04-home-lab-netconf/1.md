# Introduction

## Objectives  

Completion Time: 25 minutes

By the end of this lab, you should be able to:

-   Create and reuse a Python 3.x virtual environment, with the ncclient library installed, for NETCONF/YANG experiments
-   Find the always on DevNet NETCONF/YANG Sandbox.
-   Use the sample programs listed with that same DevNet Sandbox on your computer to begin learning about NETCONF/YANG
-   Find the current list of Cisco networking devices and software levels that support NETCONF/YANG
-   Configure IOS XE to support NETCONF/YANG

## Prerequisites

To perform this DevNet Learning Lab, you need:

-   One (or more) desktop computers (Windows, Mac, or Linux), with access rights to install new software (for instance, you need administrator access for some installation steps).
-   Internet access
-   A prior installation of Python 2.7 or 3.x, as well as PIP, and the virtualenv tool

## Intro: NETCONF/YANG

Say you want to learn about this technology called NETCONF/YANG, sitting there at home in your spare time. What tools do you need, and how do you set them up to begin learning? This lab answers those questions, with a surprisingly short list of action items.

What is NETCONF/YANG? First, the term itself is two terms with a /, sort of like “TCP/IP” in that regard. But what do they do?

NETCONF and YANG together enable much easier programmatic control of networks as compared with older human-focused interfaces, like Telnet and SSH. First, NETCONF defines a protocol, with remote procedure calls (RPCs), and data formats (XML), to allow a program on one computer to communicate with a networking device. At the same time, using standardized data models – standard definitions of the data that describes a device – also has a positive effect on allowing us to programmatically control network devices. YANG defines a language to create those data models, with individual data models being called YANG data models. Together, you have agreed-upon definitions of the facts (data) about devices, and methods to retrieve that data, which makes it much easier to manage and control the devices.

## Intro: This Lab

This lab turns its attention to your lab toolset that enables you to learn about NETCONF/YANG. We begin with the computer you use in your home lab, and then to the networking devices you have or might add to your home lab. All of us IT folks naturally want to experiment while we learn, and you can easily do that from your computer. In fact, by using DevNet Sandboxes, you can get up and working very quickly. So, this lab uses the following approach:

1.  Begin by showing how to set up your computer to work with one DevNet Sandbox, with an instance of IOS XE (a CSR 1000v), so that you can quickly be productive learning about NETCONF/YANG.
2.  End this lab with a few pages about setting up an IOS XE instance in your home lab (which may take a little more time to research and procure), which may be a good medium-term goal for building out your programmability lab.

The first part of this lab focuses on your desktop OS, whether Windows, Linux, or Mac. You do not need a lot of tools on your desktop, particularly with the assumption that you already have these key tools installed from earlier labs:
- Python
- PIP
- Virtualenv

This lab then goes on to discuss the following topics specific to your Desktop OS:

-   Setting up a Python virtual environment for NETCONF/YANG
-   Testing SSH and NETCONF works between your computer and a DevNet always on Sandbox
-   Using a sample program to show the Python ncclient library (NETCONF client) extracting the configuration of a Sandbox router to your computer, using NETCONF/YANG

Following those topics, this lab examines the topic of which networking devices to put in your home lab, and how to configure both SSHv2 and NETCONF support on IOS XE.

## Lab Context: DevNet Learning Tracks and Modules

This lab does not stand alone. Like the other labs in this [DevNet Learning Module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop), this lab focuses on your Desktop computer’s OS. Like the similar Ansible lab that follows, the goal is to slow down, think about the tools, and make sure you are ready to work with the technology independently from your workstation. In sequence, this lab sits in the fourth position in its Learning Module, as show in this figure:
