# Introduction

## Objectives  

Completion Time: 25 minutes

After completing this lab, you can:

-   Create and reuse a Python 3.x virtual environment, with the `ncclient` library installed, for NETCONF/YANG.
-   Find the always-on DevNet NETCONF/YANG Sandbox.
-   Use the sample programs listed with the NETCONF/YANG Sandbox on your computer to learn about NETCONF/YANG.
-   Find the current list of Cisco networking devices and software versions that support NETCONF/YANG.
-   Configure IOS XE to support NETCONF/YANG.

## Prerequisites

To perform this DevNet Learning Lab, you need:

-   Desktop computers (Windows, Mac, or Linux), with access rights to install new software, such as administrator access.
-   Internet access.
-   A prior installation of Python 2.7 or 3.x with PIP and the virtualenv tool.

## Intro: NETCONF/YANG

To learn about NETCONF/YANG technology at home in your spare time, this lab answers questions like, what tools do you need, and how do you set them up to begin learning? You can get the answers with a surprisingly short list of action items.

What is NETCONF/YANG? First, the term itself is two terms with a slash, similar to “TCP/IP”. But what does each term do?

NETCONF and YANG enable programmatic control of networks as compared with older interfaces, like Telnet and SSH. First, NETCONF defines a protocol, with remote procedure calls (RPCs) and data formats (XML), to allow a program on a computer to communicate with a networking device. Using standardized data models – standard definitions of the data that describes a device – also positively affects programmatic control of network devices. YANG defines a language to create those data models, with individual data models being called YANG data models. NETCONF and YANG together provide agreed-upon definitions of the facts (data) about devices, and methods to retrieve that data, making it easier to manage and control the devices.

## Intro: This Lab

This lab describes the lab toolset used to learn about NETCONF/YANG starting with the computer you use in your home lab, and connecting to the networking devices you have in your home lab. Many IT folks want to experiment while learning, and you can do that from your computer. In fact, by using DevNet Sandboxes, you can start working very quickly. So, this lab uses the following approach:

1.  Set up your computer to work with one DevNet Sandbox, with an instance of IOS XE (a CSR 1000v), to quickly become productive learning about NETCONF/YANG.
2.  End this lab by setting up an IOS XE instance in your home lab, knowing it may take a little more time to research and procure. But, it provides a good medium-term goal for building a home programmability lab.

The first part of this lab focuses on your desktop OS, whether Windows, Linux, or Mac. You do not need additional tools on your desktop if you already have these key tools installed from earlier labs:
- Python 2.7 or 3.x
- PIP
- Virtualenv

This lab discusses the following topics specific to your desktop OS:

-   Setting up a Python virtual environment for NETCONF/YANG.
-   Testing that SSH and NETCONF works between your computer and an always-on DevNet Sandbox.
-   Showing that the Python ncclient library (NETCONF client) can extract the configuration of a Sandbox router to your computer, using NETCONF/YANG.

Following those topics, this lab examines which networking devices to put in your home lab, and how to configure both SSHv2 and NETCONF support on IOS XE.

## Lab Context: DevNet Learning Tracks and Modules

This lab does not stand alone. Like the other labs in this [DevNet Learning Module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-desktop), this lab focuses on the desktop computer OS. The goal with these and the following Ansible lab is to slow down, think about the tools, and make sure you are ready to work with the technology independently from your workstation. In sequence, this figure shows the context of this lab in its learning module, as shown in this figure:
