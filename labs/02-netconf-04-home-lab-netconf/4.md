# Test SSH and NETCONF Access to a DevNet Sandbox

This lab explains how to use a DevNet Sandbox with your computer to experiment with NETCONF/YANG. First, verify that your computer connects to an IOS XE instance running in the [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) Sandbox. Then, use a sample Python program from the Sandbox’s documentation to show how to use NETCONF/YANG with the Sandbox.

## The DevNet Always-On NETCONF/YANG Sandbox

The always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox runs one instance of IOS XE, a Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000v instance. For this lab, you connect to that instance using both an SSH client and from a Python program using the `ncclient` library, as shown in this figure.

## Exercise: Verifying SSH is Working to the Sandbox

You can verify the configuration of the IOS XE instance using an SSH client. For NETCONF/YANG, the router must be configured to allow SSH version 2 connections inbound and also support NETCONF. This IOS XE instance is configured already, so you can learn verification steps here.

By default, SSH uses port 22, while NETCONF uses port 830. The Sandbox IOS XE instance uses those default ports plus additional ports indicated in the Sandbox documentation. Cisco has a static NAT/PAT function between the Sandbox and the Internet, so from your computer you use the port numbers listed in the documentation, rather than the default ports.

To verify that SSHv2 works, login to the Sandbox using SSH:

1.  Open a web browser tab to view the documentation for the always-on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. Record the values for:
  -   The hostname (currently ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com)
  -   The password (currently D_Vay!\_10&)
  -   The non-default SSH port number (currently 8181)
  -   The non-default NETCONF port number (currently 10000)
1.  If using an SSH desktop app (for example, Putty), use SSH to connect to the router in the Sandbox. Use the current Sandbox settings in your SSH app for hostname, password, and SSH port number.

1. Alternately, if using a command-line SSH client, login to the router using Sandbox parameters on the command line. For example:

   ```
   $ ssh -l root -p 8181 -2 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com
   Password: 
   csr1000v>#
   ```

1.  Once logged in, show the local port number of your TCP connection using the IOS XE command **show ip ports all.**

   ```
   csr1000v># show ip ports all | include SSH
   tcp   10.10.10.48:22             cpe-184-54-203-94.swo.res.r
   ESTAB      407/>[IOS>]SSH Process
   
   csr1000v>#
   ```

   The example output shows details about the TCP connection to the SSH server. Note that it lists the default SSH port 22 in use by the IOS XE router instance. Depending on the device and version you can find more information about TCP ports on a Cisco device with commands such as **show ip ports all**, **show control-plane host open-ports** or **show tcp brief**.

## Exercise: Verifying NETCONF is Working to the Sandbox

To test the NETCONF configuration, repeat the previous SSH test using SSH to connect to the NETCONF port. The NETCONF server on the router replies with a NETCONF message (a Hello) that lists NETCONF capabilities on the device. That response confirms that the NETCONF server is working.

To test the NETCONF server in the same always-on DevNet Sandbox, repeat the previous test, with the same parameters, substituting the NETCONF port value. For example, with a command-line SSH client:

__ssh -2 -l root -p 10000 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com__

This example shows the first few lines of output returned when you connect to the NETCONF server with SSH on port 10000:

````
$ ssh -2 -l root -p 10000 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com
root@ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com's password:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
<capabilities>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.1</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:writable-running:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:xpath:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:validate:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:validate:1.1</capability>
