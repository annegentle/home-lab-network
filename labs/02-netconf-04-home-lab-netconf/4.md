# Test SSH and NETCONF Access to a DevNet Sandbox

Next, this lab takes the first steps towards using a DevNet Sandbox, along with your own computer, to experiment with NETCONF/YANG. To do that, this next page shows how to verify that your computer can connect to an IOS XE instance running in the [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) Sandbox, which both introduces the details of the Sandbox and proves that the IOS XE instance is working. The following page of this lab then uses a sample Python program taken from that Sandbox’s documentation to show an example of using NETCONF/YANG with the Sandbox.

## The DevNet Always-On NETCONF/YANG Sandbox

The always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox runs one instance of IOS XE, namely a Cloud Services Router (CSR) 1000v instance. Simple enough. For this lab’s purposes, you will connect to that one instance using an SSH client, and from a Python program using the ncclient library, as shown in this figure.

## Exercise: Verifying SSH is Working to the Sandbox

While you could have gone straight to the sample code listed in the Sandbox, and begun using that code from your desktop OS, it helps to take a moment to verify the configuration of the IOS XE instance using an SSH client. For NETCONF/YANG to work, the router must be configured to allow SSH version 2 connections inbound, as well as having been configured to support NETCONF. Of course, this IOS XE instance has been pre-configured, but learning the verification steps now can be helpful.

By default, SSH uses well-known port 22, while NETCONF uses well-known port 830. The Sandbox IOS XE instance uses those default ports as well. However, if you look again at the documentation for the Sandbox, you will see two other ports listed for SSH and for NETCONF. Cisco has a static NAT/PAT function between the Sandbox and the rest of the Internet, so from your computer, you will need to use the port numbers listed in the documentation, rather than the default ports.

First, to verify that SSHv2 works, follow these steps to login to the Sandbox using SSH:

1.  Open a web browser tab to view the documentation for the always on [NETCONF/YANG and RESTCONF on IOS XE](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) DevNet Sandbox. Record the values for:

  -   The hostname (currently ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com)
  -   The password (currently D_Vay!\_10&)
  -   The non-default SSH port number (currently 8181)
  -   The non-default NETCONF port number (currently 10000)
1.  If using an SSH desktop app (for example, Putty), use SSH to connect to the router in the Sandbox. Use the now-current Sandbox settings in your SSH app for hostname, password, and SSH port number.

1. Alternately, if using a command-line SSH client, login to the router in the Sandbox listing parameters on the command line. For example:
```
MacBook-Pro-2:~ WO15$ ssh -l root -p 8181 -2 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com
Password: 
csr1000v>#
```
1.  Once logged in, note the local port number of your TCP connection using the IOS XE command **show ip ports all.**

```
csr1000v># show ip ports all | include SSH
tcp   10.10.10.48:22             cpe-184-54-203-94.swo.res.r
ESTAB      407/>[IOS>]SSH Process

csr1000v>#
```

The example output lists a command that shows some details about the TCP connection to the SSH server. Note that it lists well-known port 22, the default SSH port, in use by the IOS XE router instance. Also, depending on the device and version, you might need to use other commands, such as **show ip ports all**, **show control-plane host open-ports** or **show tcp brief**, to find more information about TCP ports in use on a Cisco device.

## Exercise: Verifying NETCONF is Working to the Sandbox

To test whether NETCONF is also working, you can repeat the previous SSH test, but use SSH to connect to the NETCONF port. When doing so, the NETCONF server on the router will reply with a NETCONF message (a Hello) that lists some NETCONF capabilities on the device. That response, even if you do not understand the details, confirms that the NETCONF server is working.

To test the NETCONF server in the same always on Sandbox, repeat the previous test, with all the same parameters except for now using the NETCONF port number per the sandbox documentation. For example, with a command-line SSH client:

__ssh -2 -l root -p 10000 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com__

This next example shows the first few of the hundreds of lines of output returned when you connect to the NETCONF server with SSH:

````
MacBook-Pro-2:~ WO15$ ssh -2 -l root -p 10000 ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com
root@ios-xe-mgmt.cisco.com's password:
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hello xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:netconf:base:1.0">
<capabilities>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:base:1.1</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:writable-running:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:xpath:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:validate:1.0</capability>
<capability>urn:ietf:params:netconf:capability:validate:1.1</capability>
