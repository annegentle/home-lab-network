# Installing and Verifying Postman

This short page works through two quick tasks – installing the Postman desktop app and verifying that the app works by doing one simple example. The next page in this lab then gets into some more interesting work with Postman Collections and code generation.

## Installing Postman

Installing Postman is simple. Just search for “install Postman app” or something similar, and find the download link. Or just try [this link](https://www.getpostman.com/apps). Then you can install the (free) version for your preferred OS.

(Note: Postman formerly had an option to run as a Google Chrome app, rather than a desktop app, so you may see references to Postman as a Chrome app. With Google phasing out Chrome Apps as a feature, today instead use the Postman desktop app.

## Verifying Postman

You can do some quick and easy steps to verify that Postman is working on your PC. There is no reason to think it won’t work – it’s just good to make sure a new software package will work once you install it. Here are two options to verify Postman is working:

**Postman Doc**: The Postman help docs (reachable from “help” in the Postman app’s menu) includes directions on how to use an API that Google supplies just to check out the installation. Just check [this page](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/postman/launching_postman/sending_the_first_request) for the steps.

**Repeat a DevNet Learning Lab**: The first lab in the [APIC-EM for Programming Foundations module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/programming-found) tells you to install APIC-EM and directs you about how to create a couple of APIC-EM API calls.
