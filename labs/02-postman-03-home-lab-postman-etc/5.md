# Exercise: Postman Collections and Code Generation

This page works through Postman Collections. Even working alone in your home lab, you will benefit from saving your REST API work, making brief notes about what you have done, so that you can make good use of it again at a later date. This exercise has you import a collection I made for this lab as a starting point to understand the mechanics of Collections.

In this exercise, you will use some of the key features of Postman, features that will be useful when learning programmability at home. In particular:

-   Import a Collection from a URL
-   View the description of the collection
-   Add a new API call to the collection
-   Change the name and description of the collection
-   Create the URL that you can use to share the collection with others

## Exercise: Importing Collections

Now that we have the more obvious parts out of the way, take a moment to slow down and look at Postman Collections. To show that, this next exercise asks you to import a collection that I created, and experience some of the benefits of using Collections.

#### The Collection in this Exercise

The collection that you will download has three API calls in a single collection. When you share a Postman Collection – through a simple file download, a hyperlink, GitHub, etc. – Postman places the contents of the collection into an XML file. For this exercise, we will use this collection:

The Postman Collection used in this lab includes these three API calls. The first two are the API calls from the first lab in the [APIC-EM for Programming Foundations module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/programming-found) (“Coding 101: REST API Basics”), so that if you want to learn more background, you can repeat that DevNet Learning Lab. The third API call is just another GET for different data (the list of network devices). All the calls use the [Always-On APIC-EM DevNet Sandbox](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/2e0f9525-5f46-4f46-973e-0f0c1bf934fa?diagramType=Topology).

#### Exercise: Importing the Collection

Follow these steps to import the collection:

1.  From Postman, click the import button in the upper left.

 ![alt text](/posts/files/02-postman-03-home-lab-postman-etc/assets/images/desktop-3-10.png)

2. From the pop-up window, choose the tab to import from a link. (In real life, you can use other options, but this lab supplies a URL for the Collection that was shared, so use the “Import from Link” tab.) Then paste the link to the Collection that I posted for this lab into that box, and click import. Here’s a hyperlink: [WO DevNet Exercise 1](https://www.getpostman.com/collections/f88cdfca2e6ccdb01ba9).

3.  After clicking import, the small overlaid window should disappear, showing the main window. Look on the left side of the main window, which shows a list of either API History or Collections depending on which tab you choose in the upper left. If not already chosen, click to choose the Collections tab.

4.  You should see the Collection that you just imported on the left. Expand and contract the details of the collection by:

    - **(A)** To expand, click the name of that Collection (“WO DevNet Example 1”) to show all three API calls (one POST and two GETs)

    - **(B)** To contract the list, click the name again.

5.  Find the APIC-EM username/password used by the POST API call as follows:

    - **(A)** In the expanded list of API calls in the collection, click on the POST API call which then displays the details of the POST call on the right.

    - **(B)** Inside the main window area to the right, click the “Body” option.

    - **(C)** Look at the raw data in the window below, which lists the inputs into the APIC-EM REST API “ticket” request, in which you request an authentication ticket, supplying the APIC-EM username and password.

6.  The POST request should work as is, with no changes, because it uses the instance of APIC-EM running in the always-on APIC-EM Sandbox. Go ahead and test this POST API request by:

    - **(A)** Click the blue send button.

    - **(B)** Look for the status code on the bottom right.

    - **(C)** Find the “serviceTicket” value, which is the authentication token that needs to be used by the GET requests in this same collection.

7.  Now try one of the GET requests in the collection. To do so, use these steps; note that the step’s letters are shown in the next figure as well, to show where in the user interface each action should take place.

    - **(A)** Copy the service ticket value from the POST request that you just completed.

    - **(B)** Click the first GET request in the list of three API calls in the “WO DevNet Example 1” collection, shown on the far right of the window.

    - **(C)** In the part of the window on the right, which shows the details of this GET request, click on the Headers tab near the top of the page.

    - **(D)** The X-Auth-Token header type and value should now be visible (as noted with letter D in the next figure). Paste the service ticket’s value into the X-Auth-Token’s value, so that the GET request uses this new service ticket.

    - **(E)** Use the Send button to send the GET request.

## Easy Replication into New Collections

While you may import Collections created by others, you will probably start by creating your own. So, take a few moments to try some features closer to what you will likely do on your own, like:

-   Copy one of the existing GET requests, as a good starting point for your next GET request
-   Change the name of the Collection
-   Change the description to document your new Collection
-   Create a link with which you can share the Collection.

Just follow these steps!

1.  Take these steps (or similar) to duplicate a collection. Refer to letters A, B, and C in the next figure, which match the action at steps a, b, and c in this list:

    - **(A)** Click the > button, just to the right of the Collection name, to expand a new window about the Collection
    - **(B)** Click the … button to open a pull-down menu
    - **(C)** Click the Duplicate option.

2.  Edit the name and description of the Collection you just created to describe what you might use this new Collection to do. If you have no plan, just make up information related to testing. To do so:

    - **(A)** Find and click the new Collection name on the list of Collections; the name should be the same as the original, with “ Copy” at the end.
    - **(B)** In that Collection, click the … button, which opens a pull-down menu.
    - **(C)** Select “edit” from the pull-down menu to reveal a pop-up window as shown in the next figure, where you can change the name, description, and save the changes.

3.  One common way to use a REST client app is to take a working GET request, copy it, and make small changes to create a new GET request. Often times, similar GET requests will use the same parameters, with just a small difference in the URL of the request. Do just that, as follows, referencing the matching lettered items in the figure as needed:

    - **(A)** Click your new Collection name (on the far left of the window) to expand to show the list of API calls in the Collection
    - **(B)** Click the … icon that sits to the right of one of the GET requests, causing a pull-down menu to appear
    - **(C)** Choose the Duplicate option

To wrap up this tour of Postman Collection basics, you could keep duplicating GET requests, changing them, and do all the testing you want. At some point, you might want to share the Collection with others. Postman provides several options, and you will probably want to look at those at some point, but for now, take a look at these steps, which is what I did to share the sample Collection for this lab.

1.  To create a URL to share your Collection:

    - **(A)** Click the … icon beside your Collection’s name, revealing a pull-down menu.
    - **(B)** Choose Share Collection.
    - **(C)** From the popup shown below, click the “Get Link” to generate a new link. Postman will create a link, and make the Collection’s XML file available on the Internet – no need to post to your own web page.
