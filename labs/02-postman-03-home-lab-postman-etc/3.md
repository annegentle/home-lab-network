# REST Client Basics

While your programs will include REST API calls, you can think of the work to learn about, build, test, and finalize correct API calls as a separate task, needing a separate tool. Sure, you could work with REST APIs without that separate tool, simply writing your code to make the API calls. However, a REST Client app can be very useful for the purpose of experimenting with REST API calls for any new REST API that you need to learn. After experimenting, you can perfect the specific REST API calls you intend to make, and then generate working code in your chosen language, along with other features, all from a REST client app. This page introduces the concepts.

## Workflow without Using a REST API Client

First, for some perspective, think about adding REST API calls to your Python program, with no other tools. As an example, consider the APIC-EM REST API in the labs in the [Programming Foundations module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/programming-found). At first, even if you understand REST, you may not know the details of the APIC-EM API. Before you can begin to add code to make REST API calls to APIC-EM in your Python program, you either need to read the [APIC-EM docs at DevNet](https://developer.cisco.com/site/apic-em/docs/) to learn about the APIC-EM REST API calls, or use the built-in API documentation on any instance of APIC-EM (including the [Always-On DevNet Sandbox APIC-EM](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/2e0f9525-5f46-4f46-973e-0f0c1bf934fa?diagramType=Topology)). For that built-in API documentation, all you have to do is click the API option in the upper right-hand corner of the APIC-EM user interface.

You will need to learn the details of each API call, then build your REST request, and then write code to add that REST request to your Python code. As you read more and more in the REST API docs, you will see all the details of the request. In the example of APIC-EM, you can even test the API call, viewing the API section of the user interface from the working APIC-EM instance, where it gives you the option to attempt the API call.

Summing up the flow, you will likely use the documentation for the specific REST API to discover the available REST API calls, learn the details of those calls, and even test those calls. Then you have to write your Python code to create those API calls, test to make sure those work, and do the usual programming tasks over time (like commenting and editing the code for make later changes.)

## Some Benefits of a REST Client

Because you may learn multiple REST APIs, a REST client application can improve workflows and provide some better functions than just making the jump from API documentation to writing your own code. The REST client can sit between the original steps of learning about a REST API and then adding and perfecting those calls in your program. You would still begin with the documentation for a REST API, and still finish the process with API calls in your program. However, most of the detailed work to build and test your API calls would occur in the REST client.

The Postman app may be your best option for a REST client app in your home lab. You can use it permanently, for free. You can add, edit, save, and document your API calls separate from your programs, working with the API calls as an end to themselves. For instance, if you create a few API calls for a DevNet lab, you can save those as a group, called a *collection* in Postman, add a few sentences of documentation, and save them for the next time you experiment. You can share the collections on API calls with co-workers or others that you are studying with. And most REST clients will generate working code in several languages, so when you are happy with your API call’s details, you can easily add it to your program. (This DevNet Learning Lab will show an example of Postman’s collection sharing, testing API calls, and code generation.)

If you have not used Postman (or some other REST client) beyond using them in the DevNet Learning Labs, you will find over time that they can be very helpful. Postman happens to be the most popular REST client among networkers, and it’s free, so this lab will focus on Postman for the next few pages.
