# Related DevNet Learning Resources

Many of the DevNet resources, particularly DevNet Learning Labs and DevNet Sandboxes, expect you to use Python and other related tools on your own PC. In some cases, you may make a Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) to a PC controlled by DevNet. Regardless of which you use for any particular activity, you need to be ready to understand the tools, what they can do for you. While this entire lab is meant to help you build a better understanding of a few of those tools, this web page gives you a few perspectives on the different DevNet tools and the desktop Python toolset related to each.

## Using a PC’s Python Tools with DevNet

Most DevNet Learning Labs that include Python require you to use your own PC to run Python, as shown in the top half of the next figure. You web browser and follow along with the lab, and if a lab pod is needed, the details are hidden, and the pod is available while you work through the lab. For the Python programming tasks, you will run Python on your PC, with the lab exercise telling you exactly what you need to install and use on your PC to do the lab exercise.

A DevNet Sandbox Lab provides you with some lab pod for use, but again, most of the lab pods today expect that any Python programming happens on your PC. In that case, the Sandbox Lab documentation does not tell you what Python tools to install and use. The Sandbox documentation focuses on what is supplied in the Sandbox Lab. It is up to you to know what you need on your PC to make good use of the Sandbox. Comparing the two, the Learning Labs give you scripted guidance, and the Sandbox Labs give you a place to play.

In some cases, most often in some [DevNet Event](http://devnetevents.cisco.com/), or when using [Cisco dCloud](http://dcloud.cisco.com/), you may use a lab pod that includes PCs. In that case, the PC’s have Python installed, a collection of tools, and you use a Remote Desktop Connection (RDC) to take control of the desktop of the OS. In that case, you need to be ready to understand the tools used by the labs at the event or in the demo you are working through.

(By the way, you should keep an eye out for [DevNet Express Events](http://devnetevents.cisco.com/) coming your way – they are great learning opportunities!)

## Some Relevant DevNet Learning Labs

You will install many useful programmability tools on your desktop computer by just following the instructions in various DevNet Learning Labs. Many of the DevNet Learning Labs give you some great scripted exercises to learn about what the tools can do, so I wanted to recommend a few of those labs to you.

If you were to do only a couple of additional DevNet Learning Labs for the purpose of learning more about the tools also discussed in this DevNet Learning Lab, do the two labs in the [Programming Foundations Module](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/programming-found). The first lab in the module features Postman, which is a very useful and popular REST API client. The second lab uses the API basics from the first lab to show how to make API calls from a Python program.

If you want to use many more DevNet Learning Labs as a means to learn more about these tools, the [Introduction to DevNet Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/tracks/devnet-beginner) provides a great starting point, with four modules about the topics shown in the next figure:

## Some Relevant DevNet Sandbox Labs

If you have not already looked at DevNet Sandboxes, take a few minutes to look around at the [List of Sandbox Labs](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology). If you want labs more specific to networking, just check the [Networking Category](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Topology?c=14ec7ccf-2988-474e-a135-1e90b9bc6caf). Here are a couple of my favorites for ease-of-access (because they are always-on) and for being good resources.

[**APIC-EM Always-on Sandbox**](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/2e0f9525-5f46-4f46-973e-0f0c1bf934fa?diagramType=Topology) – Instead of [APIC-EM on your home lab](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-network), use this APIC-EM. It should always be available for API calls, which is handy, without need for any reservations.

[**NETCONF/YANG Always-on Sandbox**](https://devnetsandbox.cisco.com/RM/Diagram/Index/27d9747a-db48-4565-8d44-df318fce37ad?diagramType=Topology) – It’s a lab with a CSR image, always running, ready for SSH connections to operate the router with NETCONF/YANG.
