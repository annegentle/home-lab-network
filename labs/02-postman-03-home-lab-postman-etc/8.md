# Python Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

If you search the Internet for a phrase like “best Python editor”, you get many hits for Python IDEs, and less hits for editors. Why? Because if you take the core function of text editing, and keep adding more and more features useful to an application developer, you end up with an integrated development environment (IDE). While not an exhaustive list, some features of an IDE, beyond an editor, include:

-   Code debugging features
-   Built-in interpreter (run your code from within the IDE, rather than a separate command prompt)
-   Virtual environment selection (choose the virtual environment to use to run your code test)
-   Integration with version control systems (such as GitHub)

For example, the next figure shows a sample with the [PyCharm IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/). The program is in the upper right part of the window. PyCharm allowed a choice of which Python to use among all the globally-installed Python instances as well as each virtual environment. In this case, PyCharm was set to use a virtual environment with directory “mycode”. After clicking the run button, the output from the program appeared in the bottom part of the window, where the built-in Python interpreter function ran the program.

## Some Useful Python IDEs

Here are a couple of good starting points for Python IDEs to try. As with the editors, there are free versions of each.

[PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) (All Platforms)

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (Visual Studio Code) (All Platforms)

If you want to look around for more options, [check out this survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017#technology) from Stack Overflow. The survey asks a variety of questions to professional developers. If you search on “environments”, you’ll find the details of the survey about IDEs. Also, on that point about text editors and IDEs overlapping, note that three editors mentioned on the previous page of this Learning Lab – Atom, Notepad++, and Sublime – are also listed in this survey of IDEs.
