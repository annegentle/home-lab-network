# Summary


This Learning Lab has taken us through a journey about several useful desktop tools, all with the theme of being useful in your home lab for learning about network programmability. As a brief review of what you read about, did, and some suggested next tasks:

**Postman**: If you followed the detailed steps in the lab, you should now understand some of the more important features of Postman, and have it up and working on your computer. Now it is time to dig in and practice with a few REST APIs.

**Editors and IDEs**: For this topic, the lab gave you some pointers, and left you with some work. Pick a few editors and/or IDEs, and try them, looking for one that you like to use.

**GitHub and Spark**: Both topics also leave you with some to-dos: to sign-up for cloud services, install some software, and to do some DevNet Learning Labs to learn more.
