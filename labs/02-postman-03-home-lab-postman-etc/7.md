# Python Text Editors

Python programs are text files, typically with a `.py` file type. The text files do not benefit from the formatting applied by word processors â€“ in fact, the hidden codes added to a file by a word processor would actually cause problems for the Python program. So, you need a text editor to create and edit Python programs, preferably one with features useful for development using Python.

Many text editors have features that make it easier to work in Python. For instance, if you identify the language of the program, the editor can color code the parts of the syntax that match, so you can recognize mistakes. Some will auto-complete syntax, for instance, if you type an opening parenthesis, the editor might go ahead and add the closing parenthesis automatically, placing the cursor between the two, so you do not forget to close the parenthesis.

The next figure shows an example in which a text editor has the same program in two different files. On the left, the user did not identify the language of the file, so the editor treats it as generic text, in all white text. On the right, the user identified the file as a Python file, and the editor color codes the syntax.

## Some Useful Python Desktop Text Editors

Install a few editors and try them out for yourself to find a few that you like. Here are a few suggestions and links to get you started. Note that all of these products include free versions, and all are desktop applications.

[Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) (Windows): An editor, useful as a replacement to Windows Notepad.

[Atom](https://atom.io/) (All platforms): If you plan to edit Python files on multiple operating systems, Atom may be a great option, with its multi-platform support.

[Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) (All platforms): Another in the same genre as Atom: a desktop app, multiple platforms.

[BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) (Mac): My personal favorite; the replacement for TextWrangler.
