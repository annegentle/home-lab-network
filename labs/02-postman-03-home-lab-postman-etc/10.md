# Cisco Spark

The final tool discussed in this lab, Cisco Spark, can be a great tool for your home network programmability learning – even though the need for it in your home lab might not be obvious at first. Cisco Spark is a cloud-based collaboration service from Cisco that includes messaging and videoconferencing features. You might think that a collaboration tool may not be useful for your home lab, given that you will do most of your work alone – but it can be a big help, for these reasons:

**For learning REST APIs**: Cisco Spark has an API you can use to post messages. So, it can be a nice tool for learning about how to use REST APIs.

**As a Feature of Your Programs**: What actions should you take in your programs? Sometimes the action is to change the configuration, sometimes it is to discover status, and sometimes you need to let the humans know what is happening. Spark APIs give us a great way to communicate to the outside world, so learning how to make your programs communicate with Spark is a useful goal as an end to itself.

## Getting Ready to Use Spark in Your Home Lab

Even for testing by yourself, you can make good use of Spark. Follow these steps:

-   Establish a free login to [Cisco’s Spark cloud service](http://web.ciscospark.com/).
-   Install the Spark desktop app to your PC(s) directly from [Cisco](https://www.ciscospark.com/downloads.html).
-   Download the Cisco Spark app to each of your devices (phone, tablet, and so on) from the typical app stores.
-   In each of the apps, add and save your login information.

Once installed, you can use Spark from your Python program and your various devices, as shown in this next figure. To learn how, rather than repeat the steps here, just go to the [Cisco Spark API 101 DevNet Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/business-messaging). This series of Learning Labs works through tons of information about Spark, about how to access the Spark API from your code, how to create Spark rooms, and how to post messages to a Spark room using the API.
