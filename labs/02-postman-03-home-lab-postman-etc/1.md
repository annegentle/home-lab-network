# Introduction

## Objective

Completion Time: 20 minutes

By the end of this lab, you can:

-   Describe the need for a REST client app beyond performing REST API development within Python programs.
-   Install and use Postman to make API calls and generate Python code.
-   Describe the basic features of using a text editor and/or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) when writing Python code.
-   Perform more DevNet labs with your Desktop tools, specifically those that make use of Git, GitHub, and Cisco Spark.

## Prerequisites

To perform this DevNet Learning Lab, you need:

-   A desktop computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux), with access rights to install new software (for instance, you need administrator access for some installation steps).
-   Internet access.
-   A prior installation of Python 2.7 or 3.x, as well as PIP.

## About This Lab

The more you work with network programmability, the more you learn about new tools to use. Your toolset should continue to grow. However, most people use a core set of tools. Beyond the basic Python installation, what are the most common tools you need to add to your Desktop PC? This lab gives some of the answers to that question, as shown in this figure. (The topics in the figure outline the topics in this DevNet Learning Lab, from left-to-right.)

This Learning Lab focuses on the tools themselves, with some useful exercises to help you start building skills, particularly for the Postman topic. For the final four major topics, this lab spends less time with the detail, focusing on identifying the main features, and helping you know what needs to be installed and customized on your computer.

## Lab Context: DevNet Learning Tracks and Modules

As with all the labs in this [Home Lab DevNet Learning Track](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/modules/home-lab-network), this lab focuses on the tools and getting them working. To help you keep track of the context, note that this particular lab sits in the second module, as the second lab in that module.
