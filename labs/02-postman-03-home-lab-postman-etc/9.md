# Git and GitHub

Git is a distributed version control system. To appreciate what that means, think of software as a set of files (mostly programs). With two or more people working on that software, you need some Software Configuration Management (SCM) system (like Git) to control the processes when multiple people work on the same software. For instance, multiple people can copy files and edit them, and Git provides both the software tools and processes to prevent those developers from harming the work of others.

For instance, Git allows multiple people to edit files, and then merge or reject those changes back into the master files for the software package. As shown in the figure, someone can clone (copy) some code, and then edit it. At some point, they can request that the changes be merged back into the master copy of the code, with options for which developers can allow those merges, who can approve them, and so on.

Most of what you do in your home lab for learning about network programmability may not require you to use Git, but you will still want to learn about Git. Once you move from learning to then using some code to do basic functions in your network, you will begin to have more reasons to use Git. Also, Git skills are a good skill to learn just to do well with all the programmability learning tools and to round out your network programmability skills.

## Git Tools for Your Home Lab

For your home lab, you will need three types of tools over time:

**Git**: Git includes a software package you should download and install. Thinking like a developer, you follow different Git processes; to take those actions, you use **git** commands implemented in the Git software you download and install.

**Git-Based cloud services**: Several cloud-based services supply a place to keep Git repositories, most popularly, GitHub. That is, these sites run Git, and provide a web front-end, so you can conveniently store your code in the cloud, and manage it from your desktop using Git.

**Git-Based client apps**: Cloud services like GitHub include options to access the service from a desktop app in addition to a web browser.

At a minimum, at least to do the DevNet Learning Labs about Git, you need to install Git itself. You will also likely want to go ahead and establish a GitHub account, plus download a GitHub desktop app. The next section shows the links and details.

## Installing Git

To install Git, just download [the installer](https://git-scm.com/downloads) from the web page for your particular OS. Once installed, the **git** command should be available from a command prompt. To verify the installation, just issue a **git --version** command from a command prompt; if your system recognizes the command, you have Git installed on your computer. And for you Windows users, also check out the git-bash command and feature, which lets you use Linux-like commands from your Windows machine â€“ very handy for many programming tasks.

## Establish GitHub Account, and Install the Desktop App

GitHub has both free and paid services, with the free service being useful for long-term for many people. To use it, you at least need to register and establish a username/password. Optionally, you can then choose a GitHub desktop app, install, configure your new GitHub username/password into the desktop app, and use the app.

-   Connect to [www.github.com](http://www.github.com) to sign up.
-   Download the [GitHub desktop app](https://desktop.github.com/) (Windows and Mac), and configure the preferences to add your new GitHub username and password.

## Some Other Git Options

For the purpose of learning about network programmability in your home lab, using Git and GitHub will probably be enough for SCM tools. However, if you want to look at a few other Git-based cloud services, check out these, both of which have free options that you can experiment with:

Altassian [Bit Bucket](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket) (formerly known as Stash)

[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com)

## Learning More about Git/GitHub

When you are ready to learn more about Git and GitHub, DevNet of course has [several Learning Labs](https://learninglabs.cisco.com/labs?keywords=Git) to help. Just navigate from DevNet to the Labs page, and search for Git. In particular, the Introduction to Git plus the Git 100, 101, and 102 labs.
